//! Chat / agent provider abstraction. Four backend categories
//! mirror the architecture decision in
//! [[project_agent_runtime]]:
//!
//! - **BuiltIn** — `agent-rs` crate's `QueryEngine` runs in-process
//!   against the user's chosen `Provider` (Anthropic, OpenAI-compat,
//!   Ollama, ...). This is the OP-native agent.
//! - **Subprocess(CliName)** — spawn an external CLI binary
//!   (Claude Code / Copilot / Antigravity / Grok Build) and pipe
//!   line-delimited JSON over its stdin / stdout.
//! - **HttpServer(CliName)** — spawn `codex serve` / `opencode serve`
//!   and hit its local HTTP/SSE endpoint with reqwest.
//! - **Acp** — Agent Client Protocol (ndJSON over stdio); the
//!   open extension point for third-party agents OP doesn't ship a
//!   dedicated adapter for.
//!
//! shell-core only carries the data shapes + the trait. Real
//! transports live in the future `pen-agent-cli` crate (desktop-
//! side) because they pull tokio / reqwest / process-spawn which
//! shell-core's wasm32 target can't accept. The `EchoProvider` test
//! double stays here so widget tests don't need a real backend.
