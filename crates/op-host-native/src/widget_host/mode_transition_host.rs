//! Track M-1 host glue: enter/exit Preview mode, and the canvas ↔
//! device-frame merge animation that plays across the toggle. Split
//! out of the `widget_host.rs` spine (which was already well past the
//! repo's 800-line cap before this file existed) to keep the new
//! addition from growing that debt further.
//!
//! The merge animation's pure state machine
//! (`preview::ModeTransition`) is a sibling concern to
//! `preview::transition::ScreenTransition` (screen-to-screen, INSIDE
//! an active session) — this one bridges canvas (design) mode and
//! device-frame preview mode instead. See that module's doc for the
//! full design (why it reuses `compute_frame_geometry` instead of its
//! own transform, and why content never needs its own fade).
