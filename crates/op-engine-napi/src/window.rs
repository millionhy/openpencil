//! `OHNativeWindow` bookkeeping for the player's GPU surface.
//!
//! Ownership contract (the OHOS counterpart of
//! `op-engine-jni/src/window.rs`): an `OHNativeWindow*` is owned by the
//! XComponent, not by this layer — there is no `fromSurface`/`release`
//! reference-count pair to honour. What this module owns instead is the
//! BORROW: which window each XComponent id currently exposes, and which
//! engine (if any) has handed that window to `op_attach_surface`.
//!
//! The borrow is what makes `OnSurfaceDestroyed` safe. The framework
//! guarantees the window stays live only until that callback RETURNS, and the
//! ArkTS listener is notified asynchronously (a threadsafe function), so the
//! shell cannot suspend in time. This module therefore suspends the bound
//! engine synchronously, on its own thread, before the callback returns —
//! exactly the guarantee `op_engine.h` demands of the shell.
//!
//! Every recorded and cleared window emits a paired HiLog line so acceptance
//! scripts can assert leak-free pairing, mirroring the Android player.
