DESIGN GUIDELINES:

- Mobile: 375x812. Web: 1200x800 (single) or 1200x3000-5000 (landing page).
- "mobile"/"移动端" + screen type = ACTUAL 375x812 screen, NOT desktop with phone mockup.
- Buttons: height 44-52px, cornerRadius 8-12, padding [12, 24]. Icon+text: layout="horizontal", gap=8.
- Icon-only buttons: 44x44, justifyContent/alignItems="center", icon_font 20-24px.
- PAIRED CONTROLS ARE TWINS: a stepper's −/+ buttons (guest count, quantity), prev/next arrows, and any increment/decrement pair MUST share identical width, height, cornerRadius, and icon size — only the fill emphasis may differ (e.g. minus = surface + border, plus = accent fill). A 56px rounded-square minus next to a 32px circular plus reads as broken, never as intentional.
- Inputs: height 44px, light bg, subtle border, width="fill_container" in forms.
- Cards: cornerRadius 12-16, clipContent: true, subtle shadows.
- CARD ROW ALIGNMENT: sibling cards in horizontal layout use width="fill_container" and height="fit_content" by default. Full Height is an explicit equal-height cross-axis choice, not a blanket card rule.
- Navigation: justifyContent="space_between", 3 groups (logo | links | CTA), padding=[0,80].
- Phone mockup: ONE "frame", width 260-300, height 520-580, cornerRadius 32. NEVER ellipse.
- Decorative shapes: ellipse is fine for circles / rings / pie / gauge (use innerRadius + start/sweepAngle); use frame/rectangle with cornerRadius for rounded rects.
- NEVER use emoji as icons, and NEVER draw icons as path nodes. Use icon_font with a lucide name (see icon-catalog).
