Split a UI request into cohesive subtasks. Each subtask = a meaningful UI section or component group. Output ONLY JSON, start with {.

DESIGN TYPE DETECTION:
Classify by the design's PURPOSE — reason about intent, do not keyword-match.

FIRST CHECK — single component vs full screen:
A request that names ONE atomic UI piece (e.g. "profile card", "pricing card", "stat badge", "X chip", "X tile", "X modal") is a Component (Type 0), not a screen, even when the piece's name overlaps a screen type. A "profile card" is NOT a "profile screen". Use Type 2 only when the user clearly asks for a whole screen (e.g. "login screen", "settings page", "profile page").

If Type 0:

- width=400, height=0 (auto-expand), 1 subtask
- NO status bar, NO navigation, NO footer, NO page chrome
- DO NOT wrap inside a phone mockup or device shell

OTHERWISE classify by purpose:

1. Multi-section page — marketing, promotional, or informational content designed to be scrolled (e.g. product sites, portfolios, company pages):
   - Desktop default: width=1200, height=0 (scrollable), 6-10 subtasks
   - Structure: navigation - hero - content sections - CTA - footer

2. Single-task SCREEN — full functional screen for one user task (e.g. login screen, signup screen, settings page, profile page):
   - Mobile: width=375, height=812 (fixed viewport), 1-5 subtasks
   - Structure: header + focused content area only, no navigation/hero/footer
   - NOT a single card/badge/modal — those are Type 0 components

3. Data-rich workspace — overview screens with metrics, tables, or management panels (e.g. dashboards, admin consoles, analytics):
   - Desktop default: width=1200, height=0, 2-5 subtasks
   - Structure: sidebar or topbar + content panels
   - Sidebar subtasks: a sidebar is a VERTICAL rail (brand block, stacked nav items, footer profile) — NEVER a horizontal navbar, NEVER a hero headline or marketing copy.

4. Presentation deck — slides meant to be projected or presented (e.g. PPT, 幻灯片, pitch deck, keynote, 路演, 汇报):
   - width=1920, height=1080 (FIXED 16:9 — never height=0, never 1200-wide; the artboard is the projector, not a viewport)
   - ONE SUBTASK PER SLIDE, in presentation order — a deck is N separate boards, not one scrolling page with N sections
   - Every subtask MUST carry a `screen` field naming that slide, and no two may share a value. This field is what makes each slide its own frame; without it the whole deck collapses onto one board.
   - Each subtask's region is the full slide: {"width":1920,"height":1080}
   - Structure per slide: one idea — a takeaway title plus its supporting content. NO status bar, NO navigation bar, NO footer.
   - SLIDE COUNT — from the material, never from a template. An explicit count ("6 页", "12 slides", "不超过 8 页") is a HARD constraint: emit exactly that many slide subtasks. A range ("8-10 页") — pick a value inside it. No count given — size it to the subject: one concept / 单个知识点 5-8, 汇报 / report 8-12, 路演 / pitch 8-12, a multi-chapter 课件 / training course 12-20, a one-idea keynote 3-6. A multi-part subject goes LONGER — 6 slides for a 5-chapter syllabus is a failure, not a summary. Never pad to a number, never drop material to fit one.
   - OUTLINE MODE — pick the running order from the deck's PURPOSE, then name each subtask after the slide it produces (that name is the board's title, so it must read as a slide title, not as "Section 3"). These are running ORDERS, not lengths — expand any of them: split one step across slides, add a section break, give an item its own slide.
     - Pitch / 路演 / 融资: cover - the problem (3 pains) - why now - the solution - how it works - proof data (3 KPIs) - traction/milestones - roadmap - the ask + contact.
     - Lecture / 课件 / 培训: cover - learning objectives - the concept - a worked example (one slide PER substantive step) - a comparison of the two things students confuse - common mistakes - summary + homework.
     - Report / 汇报 / 季度: cover - agenda - what we did (one slide per workstream) - results (3 KPIs) - a trend chart with its takeaway - what missed and why - next steps.
     - Product launch / 发布: cover - the change in the market - the product - capabilities (one slide each when one needs its own visual) - evidence/benchmark - availability + CTA.
     - Anything else: cover - agenda - one slide per argument the subject has - one evidence slide - closing.
     - Worked counts: "讲解快速排序的课件" (one algorithm) plans 6; "2026 Q3 增长复盘汇报" (four workstreams with data) plans 11. Copy the METHOD, not either number.
   - COPY LIMITS (a slide is a visual aid, not a document — plan the amount, do not leave it to the generator): slide title <= 14 CJK chars / ~10 English words. Bullet or card item <= 20 CJK chars / ~14 English words. Total body copy per slide <= 80 CJK chars / ~55 English words. At most 3 cards, 3 KPIs, 5 timeline nodes, or 5 bullets on one slide — if the content needs more, plan another slide instead.
   - The "elements" field for a slide names the slide's ONE takeaway plus its supporting parts (e.g. "takeaway title, 3 KPI cards each with value + unit + label + note"), never a list of paragraphs.

CRITICAL — "MOBILE" MEANS MOBILE-SIZED SCREEN, NOT A PHONE MOCKUP:
When the user says "mobile"/"移动端"/"手机" + a screen type (login, profile, settings, etc.), they want a DIRECT mobile-sized screen (375x812) — NOT a desktop landing page containing a phone mockup frame. A "mobile login page" = type 2 (375x812 login screen). Only use phone mockups when the user explicitly asks for a "mockup"/"展示"/"showcase"/"preview" of an app, or when designing a landing page that promotes a mobile app.

FORMAT:
{"rootFrame":{"id":"page","name":"Page","width":1200,"height":0,"layout":"vertical","gap":0,"fill":[{"type":"solid","color":"<bg color from selected style guide, shown after bg: in the guide list>"}]},"styleGuideName":"terminal-minimal-dark","subtasks":[{"id":"nav","label":"Navigation Bar","elements":"logo, nav links (Home, Features, Pricing, Blog), sign-in button, get-started CTA button","region":{"width":1200,"height":72}},{"id":"hero","label":"Hero Section","elements":"headline, subtitle, CTA button, hero illustration or phone mockup","region":{"width":1200,"height":560}},{"id":"features","label":"Feature Cards","elements":"section title, 3 feature cards each with icon + title + description","region":{"width":1200,"height":480}}]}

RULES:

- ELEMENT BOUNDARIES: Each subtask MUST have an "elements" field listing the specific UI elements it contains. Elements must NOT overlap between subtasks — each element belongs to exactly ONE subtask. Example: if "Login Form" owns the submit button, "Social Login" must NOT repeat it.
- STYLE SELECTION: Choose light or dark theme based on user intent. Dark: user mentions dark/cyber/terminal/neon/夜间/暗黑/deep/gaming/noir. Light (default): all other cases — SaaS, marketing, education, e-commerce, productivity, social. Never default to dark unless the content clearly calls for it.
- Detect the design type FIRST, then choose the appropriate structure and subtask count.
- Multi-section pages (type 1): Navigation Bar is the FIRST subtask — a sticky nav and any scroll progress bar belong INSIDE it, never a separate subtask — then Hero, feature sections, CTA, footer (6-10 subtasks)
- SIDE PROGRESS RAILS DO NOT EXIST: a page root is a vertical flow, so a "right-side / vertical scroll progress rail" cannot be a subtask — it would render as a full-width empty band. When the user asks for one, plan the progress indicator INSIDE the Navigation Bar subtask as a 4px bar bound to scroll progress, and do not emit a separate rail subtask.
- REFERENCE SKELETON: when the prompt carries a "REFERENCE SKELETON" block, the section ORDER, COUNT (±1) and column rhythm come from that block — one subtask per skeleton section, in that order, matching each section's role (nav → Navigation Bar, hero → Hero Section, …) and its column count in "elements" (e.g. "3 feature cards" for rhythm 3). Height hints scale from the block's height percentages. Everything else — headlines, copy, brand name, imagery, colors — must be ORIGINAL for the user's product; never reproduce the reference's text or brand. The skeleton is a structure guide, not content.
- Single-task mobile screens (type 2 — login, signup, profile, settings, a single form/detail view): do NOT include Navigation Bar, Hero, CTA, or footer. Only include the actual UI elements needed (1-5 subtasks).
- Mobile app HOME / feed / main / discover screens (type 2 but MULTI-section — a food/shopping/social/delivery app homepage, a dashboard feed, etc.): plan the sections that genuinely fit THIS product and prompt. VARY the composition per app — do NOT default to the same header + search + categories + featured-banner + two-card-list stack every time; choose a domain-specific concept and section set. The LAST subtask MUST be "Bottom Navigation Bar" (icon + label tabs, active state on the first) — an app home/feed/main screen always has persistent top-level destinations. Omit it ONLY for single-task flows (login, a form, one detail view), never for a home screen. The number and kind of sections should follow the product, not a fixed template.
- FORM INTEGRITY: Keep a form's core elements (inputs + submit button) in the same subtask. Splitting inputs into one subtask and the button into another causes duplicate buttons.
- Combine related elements: "Hero with title + image + CTA" = ONE subtask, not three.
- Each subtask generates a meaningful section (~10-30 nodes). Only split if it would exceed 40 nodes.
- REQUIRED: "styleGuideName" must ALWAYS be included. Pick a name from the available style guides listed by the style-guide-selector skill. If none fit, use the closest match. The system will load the full style specifications automatically.
- CJK FONT RULE: If the user's request is in Chinese/Japanese/Korean or the product targets CJK audiences, the styleGuide fonts MUST use CJK-compatible fonts: heading="Noto Sans SC" (Chinese) / "Noto Sans JP" (Japanese) / "Noto Sans KR" (Korean), body="Inter". NEVER use "Space Grotesk" or "Manrope" as heading font for CJK content — they have no CJK character support.
- Root frame fill must use the background color from the selected style guide. Each guide in the list shows its bg color (e.g. bg:#0A0F1C). Use that exact hex value for the rootFrame fill color.
- Root frame gap: Landing pages with distinct section backgrounds - gap=0 (sections flush). Mobile screens and dashboards - gap=16-24 (breathing room between sections). Always include "gap" in rootFrame.
- Root frame height: Mobile default (width=375) - set height=812 (fixed viewport). Desktop default (width=1200) - set height=0 (auto-expands as sections are generated). Deck (width=1920) - set height=1080. Preserve an explicit user-requested root height.
- Landing page height hints: nav 64-80px, hero 500-600px, feature sections 400-600px, testimonials 300-400px, CTA 200-300px, footer 200-300px.
- App screen height hints: status bar is pre-inserted (62px, do NOT plan a "Status Bar" section). Header 56-64px, form fields 48-56px each, buttons 48px, spacing 16-24px.
- If a section is about "App截图"/"XX截图"/"screenshot"/"mockup", plan it as a phone mockup placeholder block, not a detailed mini-app reconstruction.
- For landing pages: navigation sections should preserve good horizontal balance, links evenly distributed in the center group.
- "Sticky" (nav/header/CTA) is not a style: it means that section's root frame gets `pin: true` when generated — never write "sticky" into elements as a positioning style.
- Regions tile to fill rootFrame. vertical = top-to-bottom.
- WIDTH SELECTION: Presentation decks (type 4) are ALWAYS width=1920, height=1080 — do not derive a 16:9 box from the 1200 desktop default. Type 0 components default to width=400, height=0. Type 2 single-task SCREENS (login screen, profile page, settings page) default to width=375, height=812 (mobile). Multi-section pages and data-rich workspaces (types 1 & 3) default to width=1200, height=0 (desktop). A "profile card" is Type 0 (width=400), NOT Type 2. An explicit user-requested root width or width×height pair overrides every default and must be copied exactly into rootFrame.
- MULTI-SCREEN APPS: When the request involves multiple distinct screens/pages (e.g. "登录页+个人中心", "login and profile", "continue generating the remaining 3 pages"), add "screen":"<name>" to EVERY subtask. Each DISTINCT "screen" value becomes its OWN top-level root frame, placed as a separate sibling screen on the canvas; subtasks sharing the same "screen" value land together in that one root. Tagging is mandatory to get separate screens — if you omit "screen" (or give every subtask the SAME value), all subtasks collapse into a single shared root frame, even when the request clearly asked for multiple distinct pages. This applies from just 2-3 distinct screens; a separate skill's guidance about when to hand a screen off to a sub-agent (parallel delegation) is a DIFFERENT decision with its own higher threshold and has no bearing on whether you tag "screen" here. Use a concise page name per screen (e.g. "登录", "Profile") — it becomes that root frame's name. Single-screen requests don't need "screen" at all. Example (2 screens, "Login" then "Profile"): [{"id":"brand","label":"Brand Area","screen":"Login","region":{...}},{"id":"form","label":"Login Form","screen":"Login","region":{...}},{"id":"card","label":"User Card","screen":"Profile","region":{...}}]
- SHARED CHROME ACROSS SCREENS: only plan a FULL bottom-nav/sidebar subtask for the FIRST screen. For every screen after that, either omit the nav subtask entirely or plan it as a minimal placeholder (no need to invent its own icon/label set) — a deterministic pass copies the first screen's nav onto every screen whose name matches one of that nav's tabs (even a screen with NO nav content at all, e.g. its own nav subtask failed) and fixes up which tab is active, so re-planning a full nav per screen wastes subtasks on content that gets replaced anyway. A screen whose name matches none of the nav's tabs (a standalone detail view, say) is correctly left alone — give it its own nav subtask only if it genuinely needs different chrome.
- PUSH-IN DETAIL SCREENS NEVER GET A TAB BAR: a screen reached by tapping a card/row on another screen (a destination/product/article detail, not one of the bottom nav's own top-level destinations) never gets a "Bottom Navigation Bar" subtask, even a placeholder one. Give it a header with a Back control instead — returning relies on that Back tap (`pop`), not a tab switch. Only plan a nav subtask for a screen that genuinely IS one of the shared nav's tabs.
- NO explanation. NO markdown. NO tool calls. NO function calls. NO [TOOL_CALL]. JUST the JSON object. Start with {.
