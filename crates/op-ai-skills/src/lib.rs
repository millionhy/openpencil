//! OpenPencil AI skill engine — a Rust port of the TS `pen-ai-skills`
//! package's phase-driven prompt-skill resolution engine.
//!
//! The pipeline mirrors `pen-ai-skills/src/engine`:
//!  1. **phase filter** — keep skills tagged with the requested
//!     [`Phase`] (planning / generation / validation / maintenance);
//!  2. **intent match** — keyword / flag triggers narrow that set
//!     ([`resolver`]);
//!  3. **memory injection** — design context + generation history
//!     fill `{{placeholder}}`s ([`memory`]);
//!  4. **budget trim** — per-skill caps + category priority keep the
//!     prompt within the phase's token budget ([`budget`]).
//!
//! The skill + style-guide markdown corpus is kept verbatim from the
//! TS package and embedded at compile time via `include_dir!`, so the
//! engine ships self-contained with no runtime file IO and stays
//! usable on wasm32 targets.
