//! Compile-time embedded Scene Template Center catalogue.
//!
//! A scene template is a finished document a user opens and edits — unlike a
//! Prompt Center entry, which is text handed to the model. That difference
//! drives the shape here: every entry carries an embedded `.op` document, and
//! the catalogue refuses to load if an entry's document or preview is
//! missing. A prompt with a missing preview still works; a template with a
//! missing document is a dead card.
