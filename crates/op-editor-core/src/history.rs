//! Undo / redo stacks for the editor.
//!
//! Models `openpencil-shell-core::document`'s `History` +
//! `DocumentSnapshot` pair, retargeted onto the canonical document
//! model: a snapshot is a deep copy of the editable subset —
//! `PenDocument` (which now carries the node tree, pages, variables
//! and themes) plus the selection and active-page index.
//!
//! In shell-core the snapshot had a separate `var_table` field because
//! variables lived outside the node model; here they are part of
//! `PenDocument`, so cloning the document captures them automatically
//! (spec §5.2 — single canonical document model, no second table).
//!
//! Mutators push onto `past` BEFORE a transactional edit; this task is
//! types-only (Task 4.5 ports the mutator `impl`s).
