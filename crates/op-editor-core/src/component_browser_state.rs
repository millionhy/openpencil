//! State-layer mirror of the component-browser panel's buttons.
//!
//! The panel's click enum (`ComponentBrowserHit`) carries owned
//! `String` ids for a card insert, so it isn't `Copy`. For the hover
//! wash we only need to identify WHICH target the cursor is over, and
//! the card grid is index-addressable (paint + hit-test share the same
//! `filtered()` order), so `Card(usize)` suffices — no string keys.
//! Same wasm32-clean discipline as the other `*_state` mirrors.
