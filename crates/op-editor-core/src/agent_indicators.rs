//! Process-global registry of active "agent team" canvas indicators.
//!
//! While a concurrent design generation is running, each parallel
//! sub-agent claims the nodes / root frame it is building and tags them
//! with its colour + name. The canvas reads this registry every frame
//! to paint a breathing border per node, a glow + badge per agent root
//! frame, and a faint pulse over not-yet-materialised preview nodes.
//!
//! A *process-global* (rather than a field on `EditorState`) mirrors the
//! TS `agent-indicator.ts` `globalThis` registry: the design worker that
//! streams nodes in and the paint pass that draws them live in different
//! places, and threading a registry through every command applier would
//! be far more invasive. Access is serialized through a `Mutex`; on the
//! single-threaded UI / wasm targets the lock is always uncontended.

// The registry is process-global, so a design run executing inside the
// serve-web daemon writes indicators the BROWSER's wasm process never
// sees. The daemon serves its registry as JSON (`relay_json`, behind
// `GET /api/mcp/indicators`); the web host polls it, parses with
// `parse_relay_json`, and mirrors it into the local registry with
// `apply_remote` so the shared canvas paint animates on web too.
// Reveal timestamps travel on the daemon's clock — `apply_remote`
// inserts them verbatim and the paint path's
// `rebase_external_clock_reveals` folds them onto the local clock,
// the same way desktop live-MCP reveals are handled.

/// A parsed relay snapshot. Vec-of-pairs (not maps) keeps the wire
/// order deterministic for tests; `apply_remote` doesn't care.
