//! Editor-UI overlay + panel state for `EditorState`.
//!
//! This module owns the widget-layer state beyond [`crate::ui_draft`]:
//! menus, modals, panels, preferences, hover targets, and pending host
//! actions. Painting and hit-testing stay in the UI layer. Its plain-data
//! types keep `op-editor-core` wasm32-clean.
//!
//! This public spine contains [`EditorUiState`] and shared re-exports;
//! implementations live in sibling modules without changing import paths:
//!
//! Public submodules group chrome, picker, Git, panel, and slide-navigation
//! data. Private `defaults`, `methods`, and `tests` modules hold the struct's
//! implementations and regression coverage.
