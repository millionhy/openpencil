//! Transient editor UI state — the draft buffers + focus + overlay
//! toggles that are rebuilt on load and never serialized.
//!
//! This models the *editor-state* subset of
//! `openpencil-shell-core::document::UiState`. shell-core's `UiState`
//! also carries a large amount of *widget-layer* state (hover targets
//! typed as `crate::widgets::*`, export-dialog format enums, the
//! agent-settings modal struct, etc.). Those are UI concerns that
//! belong to a later widget-layer crate, not the editor-state layer —
//! `op-editor-core` deliberately has no widget dependency. So this
//! struct ports the parts that are genuinely editor state:
//!
//!   - the active page index (page-scoped editing — see `SelectionState`)
//!   - focused property field + its draft buffer + caret anchor
//!   - inline-edit drafts (layer rename, canvas text edit)
//!   - the pen-tool in-progress path + rubber-band cursor
//!   - the **transient variable/theme state** (spec §5.2): the active
//!     theme selection + the `fill_refs` / `stroke_refs` resolution
//!     caches. The *persisted* `variables` + `themes` live on
//!     `PenDocument`; only this rebuilt-on-load state lives here.
