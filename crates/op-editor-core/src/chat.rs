//! AI chat sub-state for `EditorState`.
//!
//! Faithful copy of `openpencil-shell-core::document::chat::ChatState`
//! and its supporting types, adapted for the wasm-clean
//! `op-editor-core` crate. These are plain data types — message list,
//! input draft, panel anchor, model catalog — with no widget or
//! transport coupling. The actual `ChatProvider` plumbing stays in the
//! desktop host; this layer only carries state.
//!
//! ### Module layout
//!
//! This file is the public spine: the panel-level types
//! ([`ChatAnchor`], [`ChatTranscriptSelection`], [`ChatState`] itself)
//! plus the shared re-exports. Everything else lives in sibling
//! submodules (per the 800-line-per-file ceiling) and is re-exported
//! here, so every existing `chat::*` import path still resolves:
//!
//! - [`models`] — [`AgentProvider`] + the [`ModelEntry`] catalog entry
//! - [`message`] — transcript records ([`ChatRole`], [`ChatToolCall`],
//!   [`ChatImage`], [`ChatMessage`])
//! - `session` — `impl ChatState` turn lifecycle + input editing
//! - `messages` — `impl ChatState` per-message card state, per-turn
//!   selectors and attachments
