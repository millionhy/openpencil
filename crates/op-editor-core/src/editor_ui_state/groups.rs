//! Grouped sub-states carved out of [`super::EditorUiState`]'s flat
//! field list.
//!
//! The struct is cloned wholesale on request paths and had grown to
//! ~190 flat fields; these are the clusters whose fields are only ever
//! read together, so folding each into a named struct (the same shape
//! `git_panel: GitPanelState` already had) shortens the field list
//! without changing any behavior.
//!
//! `EditorUiState` carries no `serde` derive and no snapshot
//! serialization reaches into these fields (settings persistence lives
//! in `op-editor-host-core::settings_payload`, which never names them),
//! so the regrouping has no wire / settings-format impact.
