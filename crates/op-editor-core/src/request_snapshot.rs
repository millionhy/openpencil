//! Narrowed `EditorState` clones for off-thread request snapshots.
//!
//! Two hot paths hand a whole-editor snapshot to a worker thread:
//!
//!   - `op-host-services::mcp_live`'s `UiRequest::Snapshot` — the live
//!     MCP HTTP server asks the UI thread for a fresh state for *every*
//!     tool call, and an MCP agent issues many per turn.
//!   - `op-host-desktop::chat_session_launch` — the design turn's
//!     `RemoteDocSink` mirror (`op-editor-host-core::design`).
//!
//! Both need an **owned, mutable** `EditorState`: the MCP connection
//! thread re-applies the ack'd command to its local copy so a tool's
//! post-apply read is consistent, and the design worker mutates its
//! mirror. So neither can share an `Arc` with the live UI state, which
//! keeps mutating underneath them. What they *can* skip is the part of
//! the state their consumers never look at.
//!
//! ### Field audit (workspace grep over the consumer crates)
//!
//! | Field            | Read downstream? | In the snapshot |
//! | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
//! | `doc`            | yes (~63 sites)  | cloned          |
//! | `ui`             | yes (~13)        | cloned          |
//! | `selection`      | yes (~9)         | cloned          |
//! | `history`        | yes — `get_history_depth` reads `past/future.len()` | cloned |
//! | `editor_ui`      | yes — `document_save` reads `preserve_authored_geometry` | cloned, except collaboration session/profile state and the HTML-import diagnostics rows |
//! | `viewport`       | yes — `get_viewport` | cloned      |
//! | `ui_kits`        | yes — `batch_program` kit lookup | cloned |
//! | `components`     | yes — `tools.rs` resolved_root | cloned |
//! | `clipboard`      | yes — the `paste_clipboard` tool applies `EditorCommand::PasteClipboard` against it | cloned |
//! | `chat`           | **no**           | detached        |
//! | `codegen`        | **no**           | detached        |
//! | `theme_presets`  | **no**           | detached        |
//!
//! `chat` carries every tab's full transcript (design turns park large
//! JSON blocks in assistant messages), `codegen` carries generated
//! source text, and `theme_presets` carries a themes + variables table
//! per saved preset — none of which any snapshot consumer reads, and
//! all of which grow with session length rather than with the document.
//! Collaboration state is also detached: off-thread document consumers
//! neither need nor may retain authenticated participant profiles.
//!
//! `editor_ui.html_import_diagnostics` follows the same rule from the
//! opposite direction: it is purely overlay copy (up to `MAX_DIAGNOSTIC_ROWS`
//! rows, each with a code, a locale key, args, and an English sentence), no
//! `EditorCommand` or snapshot consumer reads it, and it is at its largest
//! right after the import a worker is most likely to be asked about. It is
//! taken out with the same take/clone/restore move as `collab`. The scalar
//! `_total` / `_open` / `_expanded` flags stay: they are three words and
//! keep the struct's defaults meaningful.
//!
//! No `EditorCommand` reads `chat` / `codegen` / `theme_presets`
//! either, so re-applying a command against the narrowed copy behaves
//! exactly as it does against a full clone.
