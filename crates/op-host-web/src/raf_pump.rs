// Browser boundary: requestAnimationFrame scheduling needs browser smoke; the
// CanvasKit bundle gate covers wasm linkability.
//! A `requestAnimationFrame` loop that ticks while work is in flight.
//!
//! Used to drain streamed AI deltas into the transcript ~once per frame (the
//! native shell wakes its winit loop ~30 fps for the same purpose). The loop is
//! self-terminating: when `tick` returns `false` the closure drops itself,
//! releasing its wasm-bindgen closure slot back to the linear-memory pool —
//! unlike a `forget()`-leaked interval, an idle pump leaves nothing alive.
