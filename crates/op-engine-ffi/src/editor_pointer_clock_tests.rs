//! Reviewed P1 regression: the mobile editor pointer clock.
//!
//! `op_editor_press_at` / `op_editor_move_at` / `op_editor_release_at` /
//! `op_editor_cancel_gesture_at` are the dedicated production entry points
//! the iOS / Android / Harmony shells call with each event's factual
//! monotonic timestamp. Two facts must hold end to end:
//!
//! 1. The GLOBAL clocks (Session `now_ms`, `WidgetHostNative::now_ms`, and
//!    through it the live `PreviewSession` + jian runtime) advance
//!    monotonically — `max(current, candidate)` — from the event time
//!    BEFORE every early return (safe-area miss, pointer-capture miss,
//!    collaboration suppression, Cancel).
//! 2. The event's FACTUAL timestamp travels independently into the
//!    runtime: a frame pump at 2000 followed by Down(t=950) + Move(t=1050)
//!    keeps every global clock at 2000 while the Swipe recognizer measures
//!    the 100 ms delta and the `onSwipe` ActionList runs exactly once.
//!
//! So the global clock restore push (`host.set_now_ms`) is intentionally
//! NOT the carrier of the raw event timestamp — the scoped host
//! `apply_press_at` / `apply_cursor_move_at` context carries it.
//!
//! These tests drive the product input path end to end: an editor session
//! in Preview mode (device-frame presentation) receives Down/Move/Up with
//! NO intervening `op_frame`. The host clock is read back through
//! [`op_host_native::WidgetHostNative::next_animation_deadline_ms`] — its
//! single public clock readout, which preview mode pins to `now_ms + 33 ms`
//! (the fixture has no focused text input / tooltip / toast, so nothing else
//! can supply an earlier deadline).
//!
//! The swipe geometry itself (60 px in 100 ms = 600 px/s on the judged
//! axis) is exactly the shape the host-level preview swipe suite proves
//! reaches an `onSwipe` ActionList via the same
//! `PreviewSession::dispatch_pointer_phase_at` path; what is asserted here
//! is the FFI→host half of that chain plus the global-clock guarantee.
