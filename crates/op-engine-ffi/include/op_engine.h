/*
 * OpenPencil Engine C ABI
 *
 * This header has one ABI shape in every build. Rust feature flags and debug
 * assertions never add, remove, or alter declarations in this contract.
 *
 * Coordinates: pointer input uses surface-logical pixels with a top-left
 * origin. Safe-area and keyboard occlusion are separate logical-point
 * channels.
 *
 * Tail-growth versioning: OpCreateDesc.size must be at least
 * offsetof(OpCreateDesc, dpr) + sizeof(float) (36 bytes on the supported
 * 64-bit hosts). OpCallbacks.size must be at least sizeof(size_t) (8 bytes
 * on the supported 64-bit hosts). Missing trailing fields are zero/null; a
 * size larger than the current sizeof(struct) is invalid.
 *
 * Threading: an engine is owned by exactly one thread — the thread that
 * called op_create. Every other call must run on that thread or
 * OpStatus_WrongThread is returned. Most callbacks fire synchronously inside
 * the call that caused them; collaboration workers may also invoke
 * needs_redraw and the secure-store callbacks. The shell copies callback
 * payloads, reacts asynchronously, and must not re-enter the engine.
 *
 * Rendering: the engine paints the document's active page with the exact
 * painter the desktop editor canvas uses. op_attach_surface hands the
 * engine a borrowed platform surface — a CAMetalLayer* on iOS, an
 * ANativeWindow* on Android — which the shell must keep alive until
 * op_suspend / op_destroy returns. op_frame presents one frame;
 * op_frame_cpu renders into caller-owned RGBA8888 storage (used by tests
 * and debug tooling).
