//! Node-level three-way merge for OpenPencil `.op` documents.
//!
//! A `.op` file is JSON; a textual git merge of it produces broken
//! JSON the moment two branches touch nearby lines. This crate
//! merges `.op` documents *structurally* instead: it keys every
//! `PenNode` by its `id`, runs a three-way merge per node, and
//! reports the residue as a list of [`NodeConflict`]s the editor
//! can resolve one node at a time.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! This is the foundation cut. It auto-merges **per-node property
//! changes** — the common design edit (a moved rect, a recoloured
//! fill) — when only one branch touched a node and left its child
//! order intact. Genuine divergence (both branches changed the same
//! node, a delete vs a modify, a one-sided child reorder / add /
//! delete, a node added only on the other branch) is surfaced as a
//! [`NodeConflict`] rather than guessed at — it is never silently
//! dropped. Structural *auto-merge* (applying a one-sided reorder,
//! grafting a remotely-added node) is left to the resolution step.
