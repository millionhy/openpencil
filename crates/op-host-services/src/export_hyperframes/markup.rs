//! timeline (what holds for how long) and this one about the file (what
//! that timeline is spelled as). Everything is inline: the composition
//! is handed to a renderer that opens it in a sandboxed browser, and a
//! stylesheet it would have to fetch is a frame it would have to
//! capture without.

/// `canvas_w` / `canvas_h` are the video frame size — the first visible
/// board's size, which for a deck is every board's size. Boards that
/// differ are fitted into it, letterboxed against the root's black.
///
/// # What the renderer requires, and why each piece is here
///
/// Three attributes are not decoration — each one is a lint error or a
/// wasted render without it, and all three were confirmed against
/// `hyperframes lint` rather than assumed:
///
/// - **`class="clip"` on every timed element.** The runtime keys its
///   show/hide off that class, NOT off `data-start` alone. A timed
///   element without it stays on screen for the whole composition, so
///   the deck would render as every slide stacked on the last one.
/// - **`data-no-timeline` on the root.** The renderer otherwise polls
///   for a `window.__timelines` registration for 45 seconds before
///   giving up — a 45 s tax on every render for a composition that has
///   no scripted timeline to register. Ours has none by construction:
///   the animation is CSS, which the frame clock drives directly.
/// - **`data-fps`.** Pinned rather than left to the CLI default, so the
///   frame grid the renderer walks is a property of the artifact and a
///   later default change cannot silently resample the deck.
///
/// Scene ids are emitted for the same reason a slide has a name: they
/// are the stable handle the renderer's studio and its agent tooling
/// address a scene by.

/// `animation-duration` the emitter wrote. Per-scene keyframes would
/// grow the file with one rule per slide and say nothing extra.
///
/// `hf-hold` animates `visibility` from visible to visible, which reads
/// as a no-op and is the point: paired with `animation-fill-mode:none`
/// (never `both`), the scene takes the animated value only INSIDE its
/// window and falls back to the hidden base rule on either side. That
/// is what makes each scene's own attributes the single source of when
/// it is on screen — the failure mode this replaces is the middle
/// scenes of a composition all staying stacked on top of each other.
///
/// The entrance fade deliberately does NOT touch the slide box. Fading
/// the box in from zero was the first attempt, and rendering it showed
/// what that actually means: at every cut the frame is the root's
/// black, because the incoming slide's own background is inside the
/// thing being faded. So the box hard-cuts and only its CONTENTS
/// animate — `.hf-slide > .n > *` is the board's children, i.e.
/// everything except the board's own fill. The cut lands on a fully
/// painted slide, and the content arrives over the next 0.3 s.
///
/// The per-scene delay reaches those children through the inherited
/// `--hf-start` custom property, because animation longhands do not
/// inherit and the children are written by the shared slide emitter,
/// which knows nothing about timelines and must not have to.
