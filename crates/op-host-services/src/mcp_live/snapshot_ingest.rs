//! Browser-extension snapshot ingress (`POST /api/import/web-snapshot`).
//!
//! The OpenPencil Chrome extension (`packages/op-chrome-extension`) runs
//! the canonical DOM extractor (`op-html/assets/snapshot-extractor.js`) in
//! the active tab and has to hand the resulting JSON to the running
//! editor. It cannot use the general `/mcp` surface:
//!
//! * `admission::check_boundary` refuses every `Origin` other than this
//!   instance's own loopback origin, and a browser ALWAYS attaches
//!   `Origin: chrome-extension://<id>` to an extension-initiated `POST`
//!   (Fetch spec: `Origin` is appended for any non-`GET`/`HEAD` request).
//! * The general `/mcp` surface is intentionally not widened to extension
//!   origins. It remains available only to callers that clear the endpoint's
//!   normal numeric-loopback `Host` and same-origin/no-`Origin` boundary.
//!
//! So this module adds ONE narrowly-scoped route instead of widening
//! either gate:
//!
//! * It is a fixed alias for exactly one MCP tool, `import_web_snapshot`
//!   — insert-only. It cannot read the document, cannot delete, cannot
//!   move or export anything, so an extension reaching it can add visible
//!   (and undoable) nodes and nothing else. Reads and every other write tool
//!   remain behind the general route's strict Host/Origin boundary.
//! * `admission::check_boundary` still screens it: `Host` must be a
//!   numeric loopback literal on the bound port, and the `Origin` must be
//!   either this instance's own loopback origin or an ACCEPTED
//!   `chrome-extension://<id>` origin. A drive-by web page sends its own
//!   `http://evil.example` origin (which a page cannot forge or suppress
//!   on a cross-origin request), so DNS rebinding stays closed.
//! * `Content-Type: application/json` is required, so the route is not
//!   reachable as a CORS "simple request".
//! * The reply's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` echoes exactly the origin
//!   that was accepted — never `*` — so an extension the boundary did not
//!   accept cannot read the answer even if the browser lets it ask.
//! * A declared body over [`MAX_SNAPSHOT_BODY`] is refused with `413`
//!   BEFORE the body is read, so an untokened caller cannot make this
//!   process buffer the endpoint-wide 64 MiB cap. A `POST` here without a
//!   `Content-Length` is refused with `411`.
//!
//! Which extension ids count as accepted has two modes — open by default,
//! pinned via `OPENPENCIL_EXTENSION_ALLOWED_IDS`. See the
//! "Browser-extension pinning" section of [`super::admission`].
//!
//! A local non-browser process (no `Origin` at all) also reaches this
//! route untokened — but it can already read the discovery file and use
//! the full tool surface with the real token, so this adds no capability
//! there.
