//! Who is asking — the online daemon's identity boundary.
//!
//! Every online request is served against a tenant, and the tenant key is
//! derived from a **verified** identity and nothing else. That is the whole
//! contract of this module: a client can present a credential, but it can
//! never name the account it wants. A request body, a query string, or a
//! header the browser controls are all equally untrusted here.
//!
//! [`IdentityVerifier`] is the seam. M1 ships [`StaticVerifier`], an
//! env-injected token table for development and tests; M2 adds the hub
//! client that verifies a session cookie or introspects an API token.
