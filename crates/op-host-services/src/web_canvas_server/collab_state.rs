//! Collaboration runtime attached to the daemon's single editor.
//!
//! The daemon is a native process, so unlike the browser it can hold the
//! device credentials a relay session needs. It runs the same
//! `op_collab_host::CollabRuntime` the desktop GUI runs; the browser only
//! paints the projection and posts actions.
//!
//! ## The split borrow
//!
//! The runtime wants `&mut impl CollabHost`, and a host is an editor plus an
//! id-allocation slot plus a dirty flag. `HeadlessCollabHost` *owns* its
//! editor, which is right for a daemon that starts empty but wrong here: this
//! daemon's editor already lives on [`WebCanvasState`] next to the version
//! counter, the backing path, and the credential policy. So the host is a
//! borrowing view assembled per call — [`DaemonCollabHost`] — with exactly the
//! semantics of `HeadlessCollabHost`.
