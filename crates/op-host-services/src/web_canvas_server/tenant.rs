//! One document authority per account.
//!
//! The local daemon has exactly one `Mutex<WebCanvasState>` and one
//! [`SseHub`]; the online daemon has one of each **per tenant**, and a
//! request reaches the pair belonging to whoever was verified for that
//! connection. Everything that used to be process-wide state and is still
//! process-wide is refused by [`ServeMode`](super::online_policy::ServeMode)
//! instead of being shared.
//!
//! ## Why a lease and not a timestamp
//!
//! Eviction has to reclaim idle tenants without ever pulling one out from
//! under a live connection: a request that is mid-flight holds a `&Mutex<..>`
//! into the tenant, and an SSE stream holds it for minutes. So a connection
//! takes a [`TenantLease`] for its whole lifetime, and eviction only removes
//! tenants whose lease count is zero. Both the lease increment and the
//! eviction check happen under the registry lock, so there is no window where
//! a lease is being taken while its tenant is being removed.
//!
//! ## Why removal is a compare-and-remove
//!
//! M4 will persist a tenant's document as it is evicted. If eviction removed
//! the map entry first and wrote afterwards, a returning request could create
//! a *second*, empty tenant for the same account while the first is still
//! being written — two live authorities for one document, and whichever
//! finished last wins. [`TenantRegistry::evict_idle`] therefore resolves the
//! victim, and removes it only after re-checking that the entry in the map is
//! still the exact `Arc` it decided to evict.
