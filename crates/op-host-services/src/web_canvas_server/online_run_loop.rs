//! The public multi-account accept loop (`--serve-web --online`).
//!
//! Structurally the same daemon as [`run_web_canvas`](super::run_web_canvas):
//! bind, thread per connection, bounded concurrency. The difference is where
//! the document comes from. The single-user loop builds one
//! `Mutex<WebCanvasState>` up front and hands every connection the same one;
//! this loop builds none, and each connection resolves its own from the
//! identity its credentials verify to.
//!
//! ## Order of operations, and why
//!
//! 1. Read the request.
//! 2. Answer `OPTIONS` and the static bundle **anonymously** — the page has
//!    to load before the browser can present a credential, and neither
//!    branch touches a document.
//! 3. Verify the credential.
//! 4. Take a tenant lease.
//! 5. Dispatch.
//!
//! Nothing between steps 1 and 4 reads or writes any account's state, so an
//! unauthenticated caller can reach exactly the bytes the CDN would serve.
//!
//! ## What this loop does not run
//!
//! No collaboration driver. Relay collaboration needs a per-account device
//! ticket and the bridge holds one per process, so
//! `ServeMode::allows_relay_collaboration` is false online and every tenant's
//! availability stays at its default `Unavailable` — which is exactly what a
//! never-ticked runtime reports. M4 brings up in-service (Tier 1) sessions,
//! at which point the driver becomes per-tenant: it will walk the registry's
//! leased tenants (or run one lazy thread per live session) rather than
//! pumping a single global state. That is the extension point.
