//! Which routes this daemon is allowed to serve, per deployment mode.
//!
//! The daemon grew up as a single-user, loopback-bound process: every route
//! trusted its one client with the operator's filesystem, the operator's
//! device-login session, and the operator's LAN. A public multi-account
//! deployment shares one process between mutually untrusting accounts, so
//! those routes have to be shut off — not by remembering to check at each
//! call site, but from one table a reviewer can read end to end.
//!
//! [`ServeMode`] is that table. `Local` and `Managed` answer exactly as the
//! daemon always has (every predicate is `true`), so this module cannot
//! change the behaviour of an existing deployment; `Online` is the only
//! mode that refuses anything.
