//! Structured PPTX export — the render + IO behind File ▸ "Export
//! PowerPoint".
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! One `.pptx` in which every board is a slide and every text node is a
//! real PowerPoint text box. Someone who opens the file in PowerPoint,
//! Keynote or WPS can fix a typo, restyle a heading or reflow a bullet —
//! the deck arrives as a document, not as a folder of screenshots.
//!
//! It shares its底料 with [`crate::export_html_structured`]: the
//! resolved [`LayoutScene`](op_editor_ui::layout_scene::LayoutScene),
//! whose rects jian's taffy pass has already computed. **No layout is
//! ever recomputed here.** Coordinates come from `SceneNode::bounds`,
//! translated by the board origin and converted to EMU, and nothing
//! else. If PowerPoint disagrees with the editor about how wide a word
//! is, the word still starts at the same point on the slide.
//!
//! # Self-containment
//!
//! The package must present on a laptop with no network. Nothing here
//! may emit a URL: an image reaches a slide only as bytes inside
//! `ppt/media/`, and a `http(s)` source therefore takes the raster path
//! rather than riding as a link that will not resolve on stage. Fonts
//! are the documented exception — they are NAMED, not embedded, because
//! bundling faces would add megabytes to a file that gets emailed, and
//! every text box is pinned by absolute position so a substituted face
//! drifts inside its own box rather than across the slide.
//!
//! # The fallback invariant
//!
//! Every emitter may say "I cannot express this". When it does,
//! [`fallback::render`] paints that node alone through the shared scene
//! painter and embeds it as a picture at its exact rect, and its subtree
//! is not walked. So a node is never silently dropped and never guessed
//! at, and a board with nothing expressible degrades on its own to a
//! single full-slide image.
