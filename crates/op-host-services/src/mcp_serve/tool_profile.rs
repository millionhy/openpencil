//! What each MCP tool needs, and what a deployment is willing to give it.
//!
//! The tool catalog grew up serving one local operator, so a tool that writes
//! a caller-named path or reads the daemon's own config directory was simply a
//! feature. A public multi-account deployment shares one process — and one
//! filesystem — between mutually untrusting accounts, so those tools have to
//! be off, and a token that was issued read-only must not be able to drive a
//! write tool.
//!
//! Both questions are answered from ONE table, [`TOOL_PROFILES`], because the
//! failure mode of two tables is that they disagree. A test pins the table
//! against `schemas::TOOL_SCHEMAS` in both directions, so a tool added to the
//! catalog without being classified fails the build rather than defaulting to
//! something permissive.
//!
//! ## Where this is enforced
//!
//! Two places, and it must be both:
//!
//! - `tools/list` — a denied tool is filtered out of the catalog, so a client
//!   never learns it exists or writes a plan around it.
//! - `tools/call` — a denied tool is answered with a refusal even when the
//!   client asks for it by name anyway. Filtering the catalog is discovery,
//!   not enforcement; this is enforcement.
//!
//! The refusal happens BEFORE the tool runs, so a path-traversal argument on
//! a denied tool never reaches the code that would open it.
