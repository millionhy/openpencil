//! Deck → Hyperframes composition — the same resolved-scene markup the
//! slideshow export writes, laid out on a TIME axis instead of a key
//! press.
//!
//! # Division of labour with `export_html`
//!
//! [`crate::export_html`] writes a PLAYER: one file a presenter opens
//! and drives, where a slide changes because a human pressed a key.
//! This module writes RENDER STOCK: the same boards, each pinned to a
//! `data-start` / `data-duration` window so a headless renderer can walk
//! the deck frame by frame and encode it as video. Nothing about the
//! slide markup itself differs — both call
//! [`crate::export_html_structured::board_slide_markup`], so a slide
//! that presents correctly renders correctly, and a fix to the emitter
//! reaches both artifacts at once.
//!
//! # Why the timeline is integers
//!
//! The renderer is frame-driven (`frame = floor(time × fps)`), so the
//! only thing that can desynchronise a cut is our own arithmetic.
//! Durations are therefore computed in whole [`TICKS_PER_SECOND`]ths of
//! a second and ACCUMULATED AS INTEGERS: `start[i+1]` is literally
//! `start[i] + duration[i]`, in the attribute text as much as in the
//! maths. Summing floats would eventually emit a start that is a
//! hair short of the previous scene's end, and a one-frame gap shows up
//! on screen as a black flash.
//!
//! # Why every scene animates itself
//!
//! The renderer hides and shows a scene from its `class="clip"` plus
//! its window attributes, and that remains the mechanism. On top of it
//! each scene ALSO carries a CSS animation whose delay is its own start
//! and whose duration is its own window, with
//! `animation-fill-mode:none` so the element falls back to hidden the
//! instant that window closes. Belt and braces on purpose: the file is
//! opened by humans too (a browser, the studio preview) where no
//! runtime is driving anything, and a composition that reads as every
//! slide stacked on the last one outside the renderer is a composition
//! nobody can eyeball before spending a render on it. CSS animations
//! are seekable, which is what keeps the redundancy safe under
//! frame-driven capture — the renderer sets the clock, the animation
//! state follows from it, and the same frame index always produces the
//! same pixels.
//!
//! # Cuts, not transitions
//!
//! Scene changes are hard cuts: the incoming slide's box, background
//! and all, is fully painted on the first frame of its window. The only
//! motion is a 0.3 s fade-in of what sits ON that slide, which is the
//! entrance tween a cut is normally given. Fading the slide box itself
//! is what NOT to do, and it is a mistake with no symptom until you
//! render: the slide's own background goes with it, so every cut
//! becomes a black frame. No shader transitions, no audio track.
//!
//! # Self-containment
//!
//! Identical to the slideshow export: not one URL may be emitted. The
//! markup comes from the same emitter (which embeds anything it cannot
//! express as a `data:` PNG), and the page's stylesheet is inlined by
//! [`markup`]. The renderer opens the file in a sandboxed browser, so a
//! resource it would have to fetch is a frame it would have to capture
//! without.
