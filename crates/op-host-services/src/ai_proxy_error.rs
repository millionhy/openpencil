//! Typed failures for resolving a browser AI request onto a `ChatProvider`
//! (`ai_proxy::proxy_provider_for_request{,_with_chat_session}`).
//!
//! Style follows `op_orchestrator::OrchestratorError`: a plain enum plus a
//! hand-written `Display`, no `thiserror` and no new dependency. The three
//! sentences this module authors are re-formatted from unit variants, and the
//! endpoint verdict is carried as the typed [`WebCredentialError`] it already
//! was, so the SSE `error` event the browser receives is byte-identical.
//!
//! What the enum adds is the distinction the flat strings hid: two of these
//! are a MISMATCH between the request envelope and the transient credential
//! attached to it (a confused or malicious client), while the third and
//! fourth are the SSRF endpoint screen refusing the credential's `base_url`.
//! The first pair means "this request contradicts itself"; the second pair
//! means "this endpoint is not one the deployment will dial". Only the second
//! is a deployment-policy decision an operator can change (via
//! `OPENPENCIL_WEB_AI_ENDPOINT_ALLOWLIST`), which is exactly the difference an
//! operator reading a log needs.
