//! R8: input arbitration while a screen transition plays.
//!
//! The window is short (160–240ms) but real: a user who taps again during
//! it is expressing intent about the screen that is arriving. The policy
//! is one slot — the newest safe discrete input replaces the older, and
//! everything continuous is dropped rather than resumed against widgets
//! that no longer exist.
//!
//! Every test here asserts on `deferred_discrete_input` itself, not on
//! some proxy: a test that only checked "the transition ended" would pass
//! against an implementation that stores nothing at all.
