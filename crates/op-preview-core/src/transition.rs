//! `push` = the entering screen slides in from the right (240ms
//! ease-out); `pop` = the screen being left slides out to the right,
//! revealing the destination underneath (same 240ms ease-out, mirrored —
//! the plan doc names only push's easing explicitly, so pop reuses it for
//! visual symmetry); `replace` (tab switch / pill click) = a 160ms linear
//! cross-fade, both screens held in place. See the design doc's Track C-3.
//!
//! [`super::app_mode`]'s `reconcile` constructs a [`ScreenTransition`] on
//! every screen switch, snapshotting the OUTGOING scene page before it
//! overwrites `PreviewSession::scene` with the entering one.
//! [`PreviewSession::paint_framed_animated`] is the device frame's paint
//! entry point (`op-host-native::widget_host::preview_frame`) — it routes
//! straight to the steady-state [`PreviewSession::paint_framed`] once the
//! animation finishes, or composites both layers while it plays.
//!
//! "Skippable" (a nav firing again mid-animation): `reconcile` always
//! REPLACES `self.transition` outright rather than queuing — the very
//! next reconcile pass sees whatever `self.scene` had just settled to as
//! its fresh outgoing snapshot, so no half-finished slide lingers and no
//! second transition ever waits in line.
