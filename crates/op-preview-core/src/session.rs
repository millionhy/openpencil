//! source/session fields, [`PreviewSession::enter`], and the accessor +
//! test-helper surface. The scene overlay / paint impls live in the sibling
//! `session_paint.rs`; app-mode routing, input dispatch, device-frame
//! presentation, and screen transitions live in their own siblings
//! (`app_mode.rs` / `input.rs` / `present.rs` / `transition.rs`).
//!
//! All fields are `pub(crate)` because those sibling modules read and write
//! them from their own `impl PreviewSession` blocks (`app_mode::reconcile`
//! rebuilds the scene, `input` owns the gesture mapping, `present` /
//! `transition` read the live widget state for their overlay layers). None
//! of the fields is part of the crate's public API.
