//! R2B1 clock-gate regressions: out-of-order explicit event timestamps.
//!
//! `dispatch_pointer_phase_at` synchronizes the session clock and the
//! jian runtime clock MONOTONICALLY from the event's own `t_ms` before
//! the transition gate and the dispatch run. Two guarantees hold for an
//! out-of-order event (`t_ms` behind the current clock):
//! 1. neither clock moves backward, and
//! 2. the runtime `PointerEvent.t_ms` stays the factual caller
//!    timestamp — a velocity-sensing recognizer (Swipe) is judged by the
//!    event pair's own delta, never by a re-stamped (stale-ahead) clock.
