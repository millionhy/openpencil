//! Lenient (tier-2) concentric repair for authored radial stacks.
//!
//! `authored_radial_patch` (in the parent module) is the strict,
//! high-confidence pass: besides repositioning, it also *resizes* things
//! (fills in missing arc/centre dimensions) and gates on wrapper aspect
//! ratio, arc-to-parent-size ratio, and zero padding to be confident that's
//! safe. Those gates are about whether the ring is worth reshaping
//! automatically — not about whether it's safe to *centre*.
//!
//! Concentricity and front-to-back paint order carry no such wrapper-shape
//! judgment call. Once `radial_layers` has already recognised a genuine
//! track/progress (or segmented-donut) ring — and `radial_layer_order` has
//! derived an unambiguous centre/progress/track order for it — sharing one
//! centre point and painting centre-then-progress-then-track are geometric
//! and structural facts, not guesses, regardless of the wrapper's aspect
//! ratio. Padding doesn't even enter into it: jian positions an explicit
//! `x`/`y` child of a `layout:"none"` frame from the frame's *border* box
//! (taffy's absolute-layout algorithm only adds `border`, never `padding`,
//! to an inset that's already set) — so the wrapper's `padding` value is
//! irrelevant to where a centred child actually renders, and centring
//! always targets the full `width`×`height` box regardless of it.
//!
//! So this module re-centres and reorders whatever `authored_radial_patch`
//! declined to touch for wrapper-shape or padding reasons, without resizing
//! anything it didn't already have a size for. What still keeps a stack
//! unfixable here (echoed back instead of guessed): more than one
//! centre-content child (ambiguous order), a child whose size can be
//! neither read nor estimated at all, a child that doesn't fit inside the
//! wrapper's box no matter how it's centred (an authoring-size bug, not a
//! position bug), or arc diameters too mismatched to plausibly be the same
//! ring (`radial_layers` classifies track vs. progress by sweep angle /
//! naming alone, not by size, so nothing upstream has already vetted that
//! the pairing is size-plausible).
