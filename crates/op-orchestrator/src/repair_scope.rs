//! Which ROOTS each repair tier may touch — the scope half of the tier split.
//!
//! [`crate::repair_tier`] answers "may this pass run at all". This module
//! answers "over which part of the document", and the two answers are not the
//! same question: append mode narrows the *scope* without suspending any tier.
//!
//! **The defect this exists to close.** Append mode scopes cleanup to the
//! roots the run inserted, so a continuation never restyles nodes the user
//! already had. That is right for the INTENT tier — rewriting a pre-existing
//! section's spacing, surfaces or palette on the strength of a heuristic is
//! exactly the damage the tier split was drawn to prevent. It is wrong for the
//! CONTRACT tier: those passes only repair what the resolved geometry PROVES,
//! and a screenshot showing two text blocks on the same pixels is no less
//! broken for sitting in a part of the page this run did not author.
//!
//! Worse, the old scoping degraded silently. `inserted_root_ids` can come back
//! empty (nothing inserted, or a buffered sink), and the empty slice made the
//! whole per-root cleanup block a no-op — `geometry_validate_and_fix`, the
//! text-collision echo and every other contract check with it. The comment at
//! the call site called that "a safe no-op"; it is safe only for the intent
//! tier. Measured on `0808-gm-2.op`, whose footer shipped with four text
//! blocks painted on top of each other while the fix loop that repairs exactly
//! that never ran over it.
//!
//! So: **intent scope = what this run inserted; contract scope = the whole
//! target root.** Stated once, here.
