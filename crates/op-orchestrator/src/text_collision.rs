//! Cross-subtree TEXT-vs-TEXT collision detector.
//!
//! `collect_sibling_jam_diagnostics` (the existing overlap/jam detector)
//! only compares DIRECT siblings inside one flex row/column, and it
//! deliberately steps over `layout:none` parents — a `layout:none` card
//! stack is usually an intentional deck where the CARDS overlap on
//! purpose (front card hides the back one). That gate is correct for
//! boxes, but it also makes the sibling-jam detector structurally blind
//! to the failure this module catches: a weak model authoring a
//! `layout:none` deck routinely lands a LEAF text node from one card
//! directly on top of a leaf text node from another card. The two text
//! nodes are cousins, not siblings, and neither one's ancestor chain sets
//! `layout:none` at the SAME level the jam detector inspects, so the jam
//! pass never sees the pair at all.
//!
//! The contract here is deliberately flatter than the box-overlap one:
//! unlike containers (where overlap is often the deliberate point — deck
//! stacking, ring badges, notification dots), two rendered TEXT blocks
//! landing on the same pixels is never design intent. So this detector
//! applies a single fact-level rule with no name/role exceptions: real
//! resolved overlap between two non-empty visible text leaves is always a
//! defect. Detect-only — which text should move is an intent judgment for
//! the model in the loop, not a fixer here.
//!
//! The rule has exactly one carve-out, and it is about INK rather than
//! intent: a block set at watermark opacity contributes no ink to obscure
//! with, so the premise "neither is readable" never holds for it. See
//! [`WATERMARK_MAX_OPACITY`].
//!
//! Measured root cause (0724-1-gm-2.op, "今日词卡" stacked word-card
//! preview): the front card's Chinese meaning resolves to y 708–728 and
//! the back card's example sentence resolves to y 705–722 (68% of the
//! smaller block's area) because both cards anchor their text near the
//! bottom of a shared `layout:none` container without either one
//! accounting for the other card's text block.
