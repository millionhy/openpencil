//! Which repair passes are allowed to run, and on whose authority.
//!
//! Every deterministic pass in this crate answers one of two different
//! questions, and the difference decides whether it may touch an authored
//! design:
//!
//! - **[`RepairTier::Contract`]** — the pass proves a *fact* about the tree
//!   and repairs it. Text overflowing its container, two nodes occupying the
//!   same rect, a 1.2:1 text-on-background contrast, a resolved rect outside
//!   its parent. A human author cannot have meant these, and a model filling
//!   content into an authored shell still commits them, so they run always.
//! - **[`RepairTier::Intent`]** — the pass makes an *aesthetic or semantic
//!   judgement* on the author's behalf. "This wrapper's inset is redundant."
//!   "This surface repeats its parent's colour." "This white card fill is
//!   decorative." "This hex should have been a token." Each of those is a
//!   correct reading of typical weak-model output and a wrong reading of a
//!   design somebody meant.
//!
//! The criterion, in one sentence: **a pass is Contract when a screenshot of
//! the unrepaired tree would show something no author could have intended;
//! otherwise it is Intent.** `0808-gm-1` is the case that forced the split —
//! the intent-tier passes read an authored 40–80px wrapper inset as a double
//! inset and an authored dark band as a redundant surface, and stripped both.
//!
//! Intent-tier passes are skipped for a document with template provenance
//! (see [`crate::template_provenance`]): the template's visual system is
//! human-authored and audited, so it is the specification, not the defect.
//! Contract-tier passes still run — a model filling text into an audited
//! template overflows a box exactly as readily as it does anywhere else.
//!
//! The skip is recorded, never silent: [`note_intent_tier_skip`] puts a line
//! in the repair ledger so a user reading it can tell a decision from an
//! omission.
