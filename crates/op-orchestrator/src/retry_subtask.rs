//! Manual per-subtask retry — the manual layer of the failed-subtask
//! remediation feature (phase 2 of the m1 investigation report). A user
//! clicks "Retry" on a failed row in the progress panel; this module
//! re-runs EXACTLY that one persisted [`Subtask`] against the LIVE
//! document, ONCE, at full complexity.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT a 3-attempt ladder and NOT wired into `run.rs`'s
//! automatic salvage pass: the user is in the loop here — they clicked,
//! they'll see the single result, and THEY decide whether to click again,
//! switch provider, or fall back to the chat modify flow. Stacking the
//! automatic retry ladder underneath a manual click would silently
//! multiply LLM calls the user never asked for.
//!
//! Reuses [`crate::subagent::run_subtask_with_reveal_at`] — the SAME
//! generation unit every subtask (orchestrator-planned or
//! `spawn_agents`-spawned) runs through — so a retried subtask's Class-A
//! passes (theme detection, canvas-width role resolution, self-check)
//! behave identically to its original attempt.
