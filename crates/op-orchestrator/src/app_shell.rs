//! App-shell restructure — a single deterministic structural post-pass that
//! turns a flat-vertical desktop dashboard whose FIRST child is a full-width
//! sidebar into a horizontal `[sidebar(fixed) | content-column(fill)]` shell.
//!
//! Weak models (glm-5.x etc.) routinely emit a "Sidebar Navigation" as the
//! first child of a vertical root at the *full* page width, so it renders as a
//! full-width top band instead of a narrow left column. The orchestrator's old
//! plan-level "dashboard bespoke scaffold" (that pre-built the two-column root)
//! was removed in 346bcaa8; this is its lightweight node-tree replacement — one
//! pass, no row/slot bin-packing, no placeholder-height estimation.
//!
//! Runs once over each assembled page-root in `cleanup::run_cleanup_passes` —
//! the whole-doc finalize point SHARED by the orchestrator (per-subtask role
//! passes already ran) and the agentic loop (`apply_loop_finalize` ran the
//! whole-doc role passes) — so the moved sections keep their resolved roles.
//!
//! Both broken shapes the orchestrator emits are handled: a VERTICAL root with
//! the sidebar stacked as a full-width band, and a HORIZONTAL root with the
//! sidebar AND every content section crammed into one row. Detection is
//! intentionally strict (see [`detect`]); the adversarial design review flagged
//! restaurant "Menu" pages, "Navy" hero sections, top-nav bars, mobile/tablet
//! roots, and multi-screen files as the false-positives to avoid, so the gate
//! leans on a STRONG sidebar-name token + a real dashboard-content gate (a short
//! numeric header height is rejected, but `fit_content` sidebars are allowed).
