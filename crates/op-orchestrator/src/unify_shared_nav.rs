//! Deterministic cross-screen shared-chrome unification — fixes the "each
//! screen redraws its own bottom-nav → icons/labels drift between screens"
//! bug (measured: the Home screen's nav read Home/Search/Library/Premium;
//! the Library screen's OWN redraw of the "same" nav came out
//! Home/Search/**Your Library**/Premium — a different icon+label SET,
//! wasting generation budget on a component that should be one shared
//! object, not N independently re-authored ones).
//!
//! Runs in `cleanup::run_cleanup_passes`, **BEFORE**
//! `wire_screen_navigation` (Track A): Track A's nav-tab binding matches tab
//! LABELS against screen names, so it must see the post-unification tree
//! (every screen's nav sharing the SAME label set) — running it first would
//! bind against whatever pre-unification labels each screen happened to
//! have, some of which are about to be replaced anyway.
//!
//! ## Missing-nav screens: inject, don't just skip (2026-07 upgrade)
//!
//! The first cut of this pass only SWAPPED an already-present nav for the
//! reference's — a screen with NO nav at all (measured: a sub-agent's
//! "Bottom Navigation Bar" subtask outright failed and left the screen
//! nav-less) was left untouched under a "don't force chrome onto a screen
//! that may not want it" rule. That contradicted `decomposition.md`'s own
//! teaching (this pass's sibling change) — telling the model it's safe to
//! leave later screens' nav slot EMPTY because "the system unifies it" is a
//! promise this pass didn't keep for the empty case.
//!
//! The reconciled rule: a nav-less screen gets the reference nav INJECTED
//! when the reference nav's own tab set already declares a tab for that
//! screen (label/name normalize-match) — the nav's tab set is read as its
//! own contract for which screens it serves. A screen whose name matches
//! no tab (e.g. a standalone detail page with no nav on ANY screen) is
//! still never forced to grow one. See [`resolve_target`].
//!
//! ## Active-tab idempotency gap (0718-1-k3-1 postmortem, D)
//!
//! An earlier idempotency gate compared only tab LABELS, so equal labels hid
//! independently redrawn glyphs and wrappers. [`navs_already_unified`] now
//! compares ordered text/icon/event identity plus the complete outer chrome after
//! normalizing both navs to one active tab. [`active_tab_is_correct`] remains
//! the second half of the gate: when complete shared identity matches but
//! the active destination does not, [`SyncTarget::RetargetActiveOnly`] moves
//! only active styling on the target's otherwise-identical chrome.
//!
//! ## Detail-page Inject exemption (0718-1-k3-1 postmortem, product decision)
//!
//! A push-in detail screen (opened by tapping a card/row on another screen,
//! with a header Back control, and no corresponding bottom-nav tab) should
//! never get a bottom-nav forced onto it — `decomposition.md` / `design-
//! agent.md` now teach the model this directly, but the deterministic
//! backstop lives here: [`resolve_target`]'s `Inject` branch additionally
//! checks [`wire_screen_navigation::screen_has_back_control_in_header`] so a
//! screen whose bare name happens to token-match a reference tab (see
//! `labels_match`'s token fallback) doesn't get chrome it structurally
//! signals it doesn't want. Deliberately Inject-only — an AUTHORED nav
//! (`Replace` / `RetargetActiveOnly`) is never removed; this pass does not
//! delete what the model deliberately drew. Back-header-only (not also
//! requiring a label mismatch): `resolve_target`'s own `eligible` check
//! already requires a label match before `Inject` is ever considered, so a
//! literal "no match AND back header" gate would be unreachable dead code
//! (reviewed + confirmed).
//!
//! ## Roadmap note
//!
//! This is the deterministic stand-in for shared chrome being a proper
//! COMPONENT/ref instance (multi-screen-consistency roadmap item C1). Once
//! bottom-nav / sidebar authoring goes through `RefNode` instancing, this
//! whole pass retires — shared chrome would just BE one component
//! referenced from every screen, with no post-hoc unification needed. Until
//! then, this pass is the deterministic backstop.
