//! Deck-corpus delivery guards — "the corpus was edited" vs "the model saw it".
//!
//! Every assertion here reads the FINAL assembled `system_prompt`, not the
//! resolved skill list, because the two failure modes this file exists for are
//! both invisible upstream of assembly: a skill dropped for `BudgetExhausted`
//! (the phase total ran out) and a skill whose TAIL was chopped by the Step 3
//! knapsack. Both leave the corpus file on disk perfectly intact.
//!
//! Measured before these guards existed (2026-08-04): on the plain non-mobile
//! tier budgets a deck subtask resolved ~6200 tokens of always-kept Base skills
//! against a 5200 (Basic) / 6500 (Standard) ceiling, so `slides` was dropped
//! outright at Basic and cut to 271 of its tokens at Standard — and the
//! Basic-tier allow-set in `compact_skills` then dropped `slides` a second time
//! regardless of budget. A weak model asked for a PPT received zero slide
//! guidance while `domains/slides.md` sat in the repo looking correct.
