//! The shared program→forest executor used by script-gen and the
//! `batch_design` bridge.
//!
//! `run_program_to_forest` runs a `batch_design` DSL PROGRAM —
//! `name=I(parent, {...})` insert operations with shared bindings — against a
//! FRESH empty document and returns the produced section forest. Because a
//! child is nested by passing its parent's *binding* (a captured variable),
//! the two weak-model structural failures a flat `_parent` list suffers
//! become near-inexpressible:
//!   - a table/list cell cannot be emitted as a full-width SIBLING of its row
//!     (the row id is a captured variable, not a string the model re-types), and
//!   - a "header but zero rows" table cannot happen when each row is its own
//!     `I(table, ...)` line authored alongside the data.
//!
//! `script_gen` is the only caller today: the sub-agent writes a real
//! JavaScript program (`op_mcp::script_runner`), and the recorded
//! `batch_design` program it produces is handed to
//! [`run_program_to_forest`] here to build the section forest.
//!
//! ## Why this returns a `StateSchema` alongside the forest
//!
//! `op-mcp`'s generation-insert path (`batch_design.rs::hoist_generation_state`)
//! hoists any node-level `state` block into a doc-root `MergeAppState` command
//! BEFORE the insert command, tagged with the "unplanned" priority — it has no
//! orchestrator plan index to stamp. That `MergeAppState` lands on whatever
//! document it is applied to. Here that document is a SCRATCH `EditorState::new()`
//! that exists only to run the program and get a forest back — its `doc.state`
//! is discarded once this function returns the forest alone. The orchestrator
//! (`subagent.rs`) is the one caller that actually knows the subtask's real
//! `plan_idx`, so it needs the hoisted state handed back separately in order to
//! re-tag it with that index (rather than the unplanned one baked in here) before
//! merging it into the live document. Returning `(forest, program_state)` lets the
//! caller do exactly that instead of silently losing every `$app.*` key a
//! script-gen'd subtask declared.
