//! Cross-platform single-instance guard + second-launch file forwarding.
//!
//! TS parity: `apps/desktop/main.ts` uses Electron's
//! `requestSingleInstanceLock()` + the `second-instance` event to forward a
//! double-clicked document path into the already-running window. Upstream
//! winit (and the `casement` fork) has no equivalent, and on Windows / Linux
//! the OS file-association launches a fresh process per double-click. Without
//! this guard a second `.op` open would spawn a second editor window instead
//! of surfacing the file in the running one.
//!
//! Mechanism — deliberately free of platform `#[cfg]` and of any new
//! dependency:
//!
//! * The PRIMARY instance binds a fixed loopback TCP port. A successful bind
//!   IS the mutual-exclusion primitive — only one process can hold a given
//!   `127.0.0.1:<port>` at a time, identically on macOS / Windows / Linux.
//! * A SECONDARY instance (bind fails with `AddrInUse`) connects to that port,
//!   sends a one-line `MAGIC\t<path>` frame, and exits — the running editor
//!   opens the file.
//! * If the bind fails for an UNRELATED reason (the port is held by some other
//!   app), the handshake won't echo `OK`, so the secondary falls back to
//!   launching its own window. Single-instance silently degrades; the app
//!   still works.
//!
//! Trust model: the listener is loopback-only and the protocol is gated on a
//! magic header, so a stray local connection can't drive an open. Like
//! Electron/Tauri's default single-instance IPC, same-user loopback peers are
//! trusted (a same-user process could open the file directly anyway). macOS
//! app bundles are already single-instance via LaunchServices + Apple events
//! (`drain_opened_files`); this guard additionally covers the raw binary and
//! the Windows / Linux file-association path.
