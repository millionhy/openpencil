//! Design fonts shipped inside the renderer.
//!
//! Designs (Pencil `.pen` / `.op`) reference Google Fonts like Roboto,
//! Inter, Space Grotesk or Manrope that are not installed on a typical machine.
//! Without them the skia paragraph shaper falls back to the platform
//! default for both painting *and* measuring — wrong glyphs, wrong
//! weight, and (because `fit_content` heights come from the measured
//! glyphs) every text block lands at the wrong height. Bundling the
//! common families and registering them with `jian-skia` at startup
//! makes the headless render-shots path and the editor canvas resolve
//! them with no system install (parity with Pencil, which ships fonts).
//!
//! All bundled files are SIL Open Font License (OFL) — redistributable.
//! This is a curated common set, not all of Google Fonts; an
//! unbundled-and-uninstalled family still falls back to the default.
