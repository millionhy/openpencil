//! Canvas agent indicators for the design-agent tool-loop (Phase 2.3) AND
//! the single-shot design orchestrator (`current_design: DesignSession`).
//!
//! Both drivers share the same `DesignLoopIndicator` epoch/color/name/
//! initial-frame-set shape and the same `register_new_frames` /
//! `collect_top_level_frame_ids` core — only the "is a turn running" signal
//! and the epoch-ownership semantics differ:
//!
//! ## Chat-loop driver — [`pump_indicator`]
//!
//! When `OPENPENCIL_DESIGN_AGENT_LOOP` is active and a design turn is
//! running, this module:
//! 1. Calls `op_editor_core::agent_indicators::begin()` to start an epoch.
//! 2. Assigns the single-agent identity via
//!    `op_orchestrator::agent_identity::assign_agent_identities`.
//! 3. Each pump, registers any *new* top-level Frame nodes (not present when
//!    the turn started) with `agent_indicators::add_frame` so the canvas
//!    painter draws a colour glow + name badge around them.
//! 4. When the chat session ends (turn done), calls
//!    `agent_indicators::finish_if_epoch` — queued reveals drain
//!    gracefully, then the overlay clears itself — and clears
//!    `state.chat.agents_running`. (A user stop elsewhere calls
//!    `end_if_epoch` for an immediate teardown.)
//!
//! Additive only — CRUD chat and orchestrator paths never set
//! `agents_running > 0`, so this driver is a no-op for them.
//!
//! ## Design-session (orchestrator) driver — [`pump_design_session_indicator`]
//!
//! `chat_session_launch.rs::launch_cli_standard_turn` and
//! `op_host_services::design_session::start` (the builtin-provider design
//! path) both already call `agent_indicators::begin()` themselves before
//! constructing the `DesignSession`, and `DesignSession::drop` already
//! retires that epoch (`finish_if_epoch` on natural completion,
//! `end_if_epoch` on abort). So this driver only *reads* the active epoch
//! via `active_epoch()` and registers new top-level frames while
//! `current_design.is_some()` — it never begins or ends an epoch itself,
//! which keeps epoch ownership single-writer even though both drivers can
//! run against the same process (never against the same turn — see the
//! function doc for why).
