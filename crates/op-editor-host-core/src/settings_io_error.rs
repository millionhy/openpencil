//! Typed failures for the auto-saved user settings file
//! (`settings_io.rs` + its strict validator `settings_io_checked.rs`).
//!
//! Style follows `op_orchestrator::OrchestratorError`: a plain enum plus a
//! hand-written `Display`, no `thiserror` and no new dependency. Unlike the
//! transport enums in this crate, every variant carries STRUCTURED fields and
//! `Display` re-formats the sentence, so the user-visible text — which the
//! `--serve-web` daemon logs and `settings_io_tests.rs` asserts on — is
//! reproduced byte for byte while callers can match on the reason instead of
//! the prose.
//!
//! What the enum adds is a phase classification the flat strings could not
//! express: whether a failure happened while LOCATING the file
//! ([`SettingsIoError::PathUnresolved`] / [`SettingsIoError::PathUnavailable`]),
//! while READING it ([`SettingsIoError::Read`] / [`SettingsIoError::Parse`]),
//! while VALIDATING it (`UnsupportedVersion` / `UnknownField` / `Lossy` /
//! `UnsupportedCredentialEntry` — the "the daemon would silently drop settings
//! it cannot round-trip" family that `load_checked` exists to produce, and the
//! difference between it and the best-effort `settings_io::load`), or while
//! WRITING it (the `CreateDir` … `Replace` family, all of which leave the
//! previous file intact).
//!
//! Every seam is typed: `save_checked` / `load_checked` and the private
//! `*_to_path` / `*_from_path` twins the tests drive all report this enum, and
//! the three `--serve-web` call sites that used to pin a
//! `FnOnce(&EditorState) -> Result<(), String>` closure bound
//! (`web_canvas_server::persist_api_settings`,
//! `web_canvas_server::serve_options::startup_editor_for_web_canvas_with_loader`,
//! `web_canvas_server::run_loop::enforce_credential_persistence_policy`) now
//! name this type instead. `settings_io::load` / `save` stay infallible
//! best-effort wrappers, so the desktop host — which only calls those — is
//! untouched by the conversion.
//!
//! One inbound seam still speaks `String`: `serde_json`'s and `std::io`'s own
//! messages, which are interpolated verbatim into the `detail` fields below
//! exactly as the pre-conversion `format!` calls did.
