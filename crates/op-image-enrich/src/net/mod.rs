//! Networked image resolution (feature `net`): the provider ladder
//! (Openverse → two-keyword retry → Wikimedia), the first-usable-image
//! fetch with skia down-scaling, and the shared blocking bridge.
//!
//! Moved here (pure code motion) from `op-host-services/src/web_image_search.rs`
//! (providers) and `op-host-desktop/src/{image_search_session/fetch.rs,
//! image_downscale.rs}` — both re-export under their old paths — so the
//! mobile FFI host resolves design image slots through the exact desktop
//! ladder instead of a drifting port.
