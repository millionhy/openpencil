//! Test-only `RenderBackend` whose named-family measurement is 40% wider
//! than its family-blind one — the shape of the real native gap, where
//! `measure_text` resolves the bundled Roboto but a `system-ui` run paints
//! as `.AppleSystemUIFont` (SF Pro).
//!
//! Every other test backend measures blind and family-aware identically, so
//! a widget that fits / centres / sizes against `RenderBackend::measure_text`
//! looks perfect under them and shears on a real machine. Painting a panel
//! into this backend reproduces the machine: a fitter that measured blind
//! emits a string too wide for its column, and
//! [`PaintedRun::width_in_paint_family`] catches it.
//!
//! The cross-panel guard in `text_metrics_paint_tests` is the intended
//! consumer — assert every captured run fits the column it was painted into.
