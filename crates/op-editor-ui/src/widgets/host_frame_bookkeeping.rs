//! Per-frame bookkeeping both host spines do around paint: rotating the
//! panel caches' owner tokens, constructing canvas layout transitions,
//! and folding the animation wake-up deadlines.
//!
//! All three were byte-identical in `op-host-native/src/widget_host.rs`
//! and `op-host-web/src/widget_host.rs`. They are pure over
//! `EditorState` + the widget-layer scene / transition types, so they
//! live here and each host keeps only the fields and the platform
//! clauses that genuinely differ (the native host adds gesture-degrade,
//! pan-cache-restore, live-preview and git-clone wake-ups; the web host
//! has no deadline pump of its own).
