//! Toast-banner flow shared by both widget hosts.
//!
//! Mirrors `html_import_diagnostics_flow`: every host-visible transition —
//! placement, press, dismissal, the scheduled expiry wake-up — is
//! `EditorState` mutation plus widget-layer hit-tests, so `op-host-native` and
//! `op-host-web` each keep a thin arm that supplies the viewport and the
//! `mark_dirty()` tail. Both hosts behave identically because there is only
//! one implementation.
//!
//! The banner is non-modal: [`press`] returns `false` for a point outside it,
//! so the canvas underneath keeps receiving presses while a notice is up. It
//! is likewise off the Escape ladder — it takes no focus, and eating a keypress
//! aimed at the canvas to close a self-expiring banner would be a worse trade
//! than leaving it to time out.
