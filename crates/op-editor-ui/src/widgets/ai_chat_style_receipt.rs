//! "Style: Dimension ✕" — what the next generation will actually use.
//!
//! The Asset Center already shows a pin: the card is outlined, the chip says
//! 已钉住. But the place a person presses Generate is here, and this is where
//! the pin was invisible. Two separate failures shipped looking identical from
//! the outside — a pin that never reached the plan, and a pin that reached it
//! carrying no readable values — and in both the user saw only that the colours
//! were wrong. Neither was diagnosable from the editor.
//!
//! So the row answers two questions at a glance, and the colour band is the
//! second one. The name says *which* style is in force; the band says whether
//! anything could be read out of it. An empty band on a named style is the
//! visible form of "this file parsed, but its values did not" — the condition
//! that previously required running a probe against the file to detect.
//!
//! It says nothing when there is nothing true to say: a pin naming a guide
//! that no longer exists shows no row, because generation has already fallen
//! back to choosing its own style and naming the dead guide would replace one
//! silent failure with a loud false one.
