//! Owner-scoped layer-row model cache shared by paint and host hit tests.
//!
//! `LayerPanel::from_editor` re-walks the whole active-page `PenNode`
//! tree and allocates ~4 `String`s per node EVERY frame, then
//! `layers_content_width` measures every label. Paint was already
//! virtualized (`visible_row_range`), but the DATA build was not — so
//! caret-blink / chat-streaming / cursor-coalescing repaints, which do
//! not touch the layer tree, still paid the full walk + measure.
//!
//! This caches the built row model (`pages` + `items` + both content
//! widths) in a thread-local single slot, keyed on the CHEAP inputs
//! that actually change the row set / labels:
//!
//! * `document_revision` — the monotonic content-revision counter on
//!   `EditorState`; ANY node id / name / kind / visibility / lock /
//!   children edit bumps it, so it stands in for a value-hash of the
//!   whole tree (page names live on the doc too, so they ride it).
//! * `active_page_index` — selects which page's children walk and which
//!   page row reads `active`.
//! * a fingerprint of the collapsed-layer set — collapse is stored on
//!   `editor_ui` (NOT the doc, so it never bumps the revision) and it
//!   changes BOTH the `collapsed` flag AND the flattened row set (a
//!   collapsed container hides its subtree).
//! * a fingerprint of the inline-rename draft — it rewrites the target
//!   row's label + `renaming` flag.
//!
//! ## Why selection / hover are DELIBERATELY absent from the key
//!
//! Selection and hover (`selection`, `hovered_layer_id`,
//! `hovered_page_index`) only tint / reveal affordances — they change no
//! label, depth, order, or content width. They are therefore stripped
//! from the cached `LayerItem` / `PageItem` entirely and applied by the
//! panel as a LIVE OVERLAY at paint / hit-test time (see
//! `LayerPanel::is_row_selected` / `is_row_hovered` / `is_page_hovered`).
//! Keeping them out of the key is what lets a selection-only or
//! hover-only change still hit the cache — the common case while the
//! user clicks around or sweeps the mouse over rows.
//!
//! ## Owner scoping (why, and how it differs from the transcript cache)
//!
//! The key uses a PER-DOCUMENT revision counter, not a global value
//! hash: two independent `EditorState`s each start at revision 0, so
//! host A (revision 3) and host B (revision 3) can carry DIFFERENT trees
//! under an IDENTICAL key. A single process-wide thread-local slot must
//! therefore never serve host B's rows to host A. Every persistent host
//! pulls ONE opaque `owner` id ([`next_owner`]) and passes it to the hot
//! (paint) resolve; the slot is served ONLY when `slot_owner == owner`
//! AND the key matches. Unlike the transcript cache — whose full
//! value-hash key lets it serve on key-match regardless of owner — this
//! cache makes owner part of the READ predicate.
//!
//! Owner ROTATION: page switches do NOT rotate — `active_page_index` is in
//! the key, so a switch invalidates via the key itself. WHOLE-DOCUMENT
//! replacements MUST rotate (hosts call `force_rotate_layer_panel_owner()`
//! at every open / new / import / live-sync / MCP-replace seam): a fresh
//! document restarts the revision counter at 0, so without rotation the
//! (revision, page) key can alias the previous document's rows. Beyond
//! that, the owner keeps two different panels (two hosts, or a host and a
//! unit test) that share a worker thread from cross-serving on a
//! coincidental revision-counter collision.
//!
//! [`UNOWNED`] (`0`) is the cache-BYPASS sentinel: `from_editor`
//! (primarily unit tests and one-off callers without a persistent host)
//! resolves under it and ALWAYS gets a fresh build that never reads or
//! writes the shared slot. Persistent hosts use one owned resolve for paint,
//! click, scroll, geometry, and accessibility so all hot paths share rows.
//!
//! Precedent: `ai_chat_transcript_cache.rs` (the owner-scoped
//! thread-local slot pattern) and `op-pen-loader/src/measure_cache.rs`.
