//! Cross-frame memo for `property_panel_typography::font_picker_entries`.
//!
//! The searchable Typography font picker re-lowercases + substring-matches
//! EVERY bundled/system/imported family on every call while the dropdown is
//! open. `PropertyPanel` is rebuilt fresh from `EditorState` every frame (no
//! persistent host-owned instance survives across frames — the same
//! situation as the icon picker / component browser), and it calls
//! `font_picker_entries` from up to five different accessors in a single
//! frame (paint, action dispatch, hover tracking, outside-click contains,
//! max-scroll) — all with the SAME live inputs — plus again on every
//! subsequent repaint even when neither the family lists nor the search
//! query changed.
//!
//! `font_picker_entries` is a PURE function of `(imported_families,
//! bundled_families, system_families, query)` — no document identity leaks into its
//! result — so an identical triple always yields an identical result
//! regardless of which `EditorState` produced it. That is what lets this
//! cache skip owner-scoping entirely (unlike `layer_panel_cache`, whose
//! per-document revision counter CAN coincidentally collide across
//! independent documents at the same revision number): the key compares
//! all three family lists by FULL VALUE equality (never a
//! pointer or a length shortcut), so a collision is impossible except when
//! the inputs are truly byte-identical — in which case serving the cached
//! result is correct by construction.
//!
//! One shared slot suffices (not a per-caller/per-owner set): every caller
//! within a frame reads the same live lists and query off `EditorState`, so
//! they all hit the same slot.
