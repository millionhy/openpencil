//! Slides panel — the left rail's page-navigator tab.
//!
//! One row per top-level board, in page order, and a row is a CARD: a
//! rounded surface one step off the rail, holding a real rendered
//! thumbnail of the board with a round slide-number chip riding its
//! top-left corner. Clicking a row frames that board; dragging one
//! reorders the deck; the bar pinned to the rail's bottom edge presents
//! the deck and exports it. It is the
//! deck's only navigator — what a slide IS, which one the camera is on
//! and how a reorder commits all come from
//! [`crate::widgets::deck_boards`], so the rail can never disagree with
//! the presentation about the order.
//!
//! **Rows carry no name.** The board's name is already on the board, as
//! the frame label the canvas paints above it; repeating it under every
//! thumbnail bought a second text baseline, a truncation rule and a
//! taller row for information the user is looking straight at. The list
//! is a sequence of pictures — the eye counts positions and recognises
//! slides, which is what a navigator is for.
//!
//! **This widget paints a thumbnail PLACEHOLDER, never a thumbnail.**
//! Rendering a board is platform work — a second skia surface per board
//! — so the host paints its cached rasters into [`SlidesPanelLayout::thumb_rect`]
//! after the widget has painted. A host without a local renderer (the
//! browser) simply paints nothing there and the placeholder stands.
//! Because the blit lands ON the plate, everything that has to sit above
//! a thumbnail lives in [`SlidesPanel::paint_overlay`], which every host
//! calls after its own blit — see that method for the contract.
//!
//! Every rect is derived WITHOUT measuring text — rows are a fixed
//! height for a given rail width — so the host's hit-test and the paint
//! pass compute the same layout from the same four inputs (panel rect,
//! row count, board aspect, scroll offset).
