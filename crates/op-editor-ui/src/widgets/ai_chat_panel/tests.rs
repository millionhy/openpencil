//! Layout + hit-test unit tests for [`super::AIChatPlaceholder`].

//! | `tests/support.rs`        | fixtures + recording `RenderBackend` |

//! | `tests/footer_layout.rs`  | bottom toolbar + agents picker       |

// `ai_chat_panel.rs` declares this module with an explicit `#[path]`, so
// the child modules need explicit paths too (rustc otherwise resolves
// them against `ai_chat_panel/` instead of `ai_chat_panel/tests/`).

// Re-exported so the `tests_paint` / `tests_transcript` siblings keep
// reaching the shared fixtures through `super::tests::…`.
