#!/usr/bin/env bash
# crates/op-web-sdk/tools/build-wasm.sh — cargo + wasm-bindgen + wasm-opt
# build + bundle gate for op-web-sdk.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Verify prerequisites: cargo, wasm-bindgen, wasm-opt, node, gzip.
#   2. cargo build -p op-web-sdk --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
#        --features canvaskit --release
#      Note: --no-default-features is NOT needed — op-web-sdk's [features]
#      default is empty (default = []), so there are no default features to
#      suppress.
#   3. wasm-bindgen --target web → crates/op-web-sdk/pkg/
#      Output: pkg/op_web_sdk_bg.wasm + pkg/op_web_sdk.js + pkg/*.d.ts.
#      The artifact is the raw wasm-bindgen pkg/ directory — no separate
#      CanvasKit sub-asset assembly is needed because op-web-sdk is pure
#      document logic; CanvasKit itself is loaded externally by the host page.
#   4. Assert 0 env.* imports in the raw bindgen wasm (LinkError guard).
#   5. wasm-opt -Oz (with the rustc-emitted WebAssembly feature flags) then
#      gzip size <= OP_WEB_SDK_WASM_GZIP_LIMIT_BYTES (default 6 291 456 = 6 MiB).
#      The SDK is pure logic with no CanvasKit WASM included — the ceiling
#      is its own tripwire, not op-host-web's, and is now measured: see below.
#
# This approach mirrors tools/check-wasm-bundle.sh (op-host-web gate) exactly:
# cargo build → wasm-bindgen → wasm-opt, without wasm-pack.  This removes the
# wasm-pack version fragility (0.13.1 is broken on stable Rust) and keeps the
# two gates consistent.
#
# This script is the local counterpart to
# `.github/workflows/web-sdk-bundle.yml`; keep the two recipes aligned.
#
# Exit semantics:
#   0   all checks PASS.
#   1   any check FAILED — message names which one.
#   2   prerequisite missing.

# rustc-emitted WebAssembly feature flags (matches op-host-web gate). Kept as

# binaryen (v117+) split bulk-memory into `bulk-memory` + `bulk-memory-opt`,
# while older binaryen (e.g. Ubuntu's apt `binaryen`) predates the split and its
# single `--enable-bulk-memory` already covers memory.copy/fill. Passing an
# unknown flag hard-fails wasm-opt, so the invocation below filters this list

# Gzip ceiling. Its own number, NOT op-host-web's — that bundle re-baselined to
# 6 MiB on its own measurement (`tools/check-wasm-bundle.sh`).
#
# Measured 2026-08-09: this bundle gzips to 5 200 519 bytes, having taken the
# same benefit as op-host-web from moving the preview JPEGs and scene-template
# `.op` documents out of the binary (7 472 939 -> 5 200 519 across both
# rounds). The ceiling is that measurement + ~20% headroom, rounded up to a
# whole MiB: a tripwire 3 MiB above the real number catches nothing, which is
# why it moves down with the bundle rather than staying where it was set.
#
# This viewer keeps the icon catalog EMBEDDED (`op-editor-ui`'s
# `runtime-icon-catalog` feature is opt-in and only op-host-web opts in): the
# SDK renders iconFont nodes but has no daemon to fetch a catalog from, so for
# it "not fetched yet" would mean "never".
