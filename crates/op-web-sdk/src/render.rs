//! CanvasKit render loop for the read-only `Viewer`.
//!
//! `attach_canvas` initialises a `CanvasKitBackend` from `op-host-web` and
//! installs a `requestAnimationFrame` pump that repaints the document scene
//! whenever the dirty state says so. The widget facade is entirely delegated
//! to `viewer_host::paint_scene` — this file owns only the lifecycle glue.
//!
//! Invariants this module maintains (the pure transition rules live in
//! `crate::dirty_state`; this file owns the wasm plumbing around them):
//!
//! 1. The scene is never deep-cloned per frame. `RenderInner::scene` is an
//!    `Rc<LayoutScene>`; the pump clones the `Rc` (a refcount bump) instead
//!    of the `LayoutScene` itself.
//! 2. The pump idles when clean instead of rescheduling forever. Every
//!    dirty-setting entry point (`mark_dirty`, `push_scene`,
//!    `push_viewport_to_render`) routes through `mark_and_arm`, the only
//!    place allowed to make the clean-to-dirty transition. `scheduled` is
//!    committed only after `requestAnimationFrame` actually succeeded. A
//!    rejected request is retried synchronously inside `arm_pump` against
//!    the SAME bounded failure breaker a failed paint uses
//!    (`DirtyState::record_failure`, budget `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES`) —
//!    so a persistently rejected request cannot freeze the viewer waiting
//!    on some future external mark that may never come: within one
//!    `arm_pump` call the state either ends up armed, or the breaker trips
//!    and logs once, with no external help required.
//! 3. Dirty is consumed only by a paint that ran to completion, and only
//!    for the generation snapshotted before the paint — a mark arriving
//!    while the paint runs survives (the dirty state lives outside the
//!    `RefCell` the pump borrows, so re-entrant marks land) and re-arms.
//!    A failed paint re-marks + re-arms with the same bounded budget as
//!    (2), then stops with one console error until new content arrives.
//!    Generation counters (`content_gen` / `painted_gen`) wrap via
//!    `wrapping_add`; every comparison against them is `!=`, never `>`,
//!    so a wrap can never alias a newer generation as already-painted —
//!    see `crate::dirty_state`'s module doc. The failure breaker is owned
//!    by whichever generation is current when it trips, not by whichever
//!    paint happens to finish afterwards: an older, already in-flight
//!    paint's success (`finish_paint_success`) never resets a newer
//!    generation's tripped breaker and never asks this pump to call
//!    `arm_pump` again while it is tripped — only a fresh `mark_dirty()`
//!    reopens it. See `DirtyState::finish_paint_success`'s doc comment.
//! 4. A `push_scene` / `push_viewport_to_render` call queues its payload
//!    in a dedicated `Cell` (`pending_scene` / `pending_viewport`)
//!    OUTSIDE the `inner` `RefCell` the pump holds during paint, rather
//!    than writing `inner` directly. That keeps the dirty-generation bump
//!    those calls make honest even when they land while a paint is in
//!    flight: the write can never be silently skipped by a failed
//!    `try_borrow_mut`, and `paint_frame` drains the pending slot into
//!    `inner` at the very start of every paint attempt, before reading
//!    scene/viewport state to paint.
//! 5. `detach` (and the `attach_canvas` re-attach path through it) cancels
//!    any armed-but-not-yet-fired animation frame AND explicitly breaks the
//!    closure ownership cycle, so an *idle* pump does not leak the closure,
//!    render state, CanvasKit backend, or scene. Drop chain: `detach` takes
//!    the `PumpHandle` out of `PUMP` and drops the `Closure` stored inside
//!    it; the closure's captured `Rc<RenderShared>` and `Rc<PumpHandle>`
//!    strong refs die with it; `RENDER` was already cleared, so
//!    `RenderShared` (→ `RenderInner` → `CanvasKitBackend` + the scene
//!    `Rc`) deallocates, and the local `PumpHandle` Rc is the last one.
