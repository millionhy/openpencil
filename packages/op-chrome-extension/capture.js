/**
 * Capture pipeline: run the canonical OpenPencil DOM extractor in the active
 * tab and pull its JSON back into the extension.
 *
 * The extractor (`vendor/snapshot-extractor.js`, a byte-for-byte copy of
 * `crates/op-html/assets/snapshot-extractor.js`) is a console-oriented IIFE:
 * it returns nothing, copies its output to the clipboard, and triggers a
 * `snapshot.json` download. We therefore run it between two small harness
 * injections that patch `URL.createObjectURL`, `HTMLAnchorElement.click` and
 * `navigator.clipboard.writeText` in the extension's ISOLATED world (the page
 * never sees those patches), capture the Blob the extractor builds, and
 * restore the originals. The extractor file itself is never modified — a
 * drift check (`scripts/check-extractor-sync.sh`) fails the moment the copy
 * and the Rust asset disagree.
 *
 * The extractor reads geometry and styles through `getComputedStyle` /
 * `getBoundingClientRect`, which the isolated world can do, so no MAIN-world
 * injection (and no page-CSP exposure) is needed.
 *
 * Snapshot text is pulled back in slices instead of one giant return value:
 * an extractor result can reach tens of MB (it embeds rasterized images up to
 * 24 MB) and `chrome.scripting.executeScript` has to structured-clone the
 * result across a process boundary. 4 MiB per hop stays far below any IPC
 * limit while keeping the number of round trips small (12 for a maximum 48 MB page).
 * Which slice to ask for, whether the answer was acceptable, whether the
 * total adds up, and whether the payload carries the extractor's `truncated`
 * flag are all decided by the Rust core's `ChunkPlan`; this file only moves
 * the bytes. The joining stays here because slicing is by UTF-16 index and
 * only JS can rejoin a split surrogate pair exactly.
 *
 * The functions injected into the tab necessarily stay JavaScript — they are
 * serialized and evaluated inside the page's process.

 *   put it; capturing from the very top is the one scroll position where
