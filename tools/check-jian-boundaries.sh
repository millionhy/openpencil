# Step 1a Phase C Task 4 / spec v19 §11 + §12.3 boundary invariants.
#
# Verifies the following Jian crate boundary invariants from outside the
# Rust build system. Run from the repo root.
#
# (The former Invariant 1 — "the app crate must not depend directly on
#  any jian-* crate" — was dropped in Phase 1 Task 1.2 along with the
#  old placeholder crate. The Phase 7.3 reorg's `op-app` composition-root
#  crate was removed 2026-06-19 as an orphan — nothing depended on it and
#  the editor-UI composition already lives in op-editor-ui. Reinstate an
#  equivalent facade check if a real app crate is reintroduced.)
#
# Invariant 2 (§11.1, §12.3 — REVISED 2026-07-20): mobile targets
#   (both CI architectures for Android and iOS) must NOT pull
#   `jian-host-desktop` (desktop GUI host glue — winit / glutin /
#   GLContextProvider impl that has no mobile equivalent) or `rquickjs*`
#   (desktop script generation; upstream has no mobile bindings). Per the
#   2026-05-10 user directive (jian will eventually need iOS and
#   Android), `jian-skia` is now ALLOWED on mobile targets — the
#   widget render stack (skia-safe + jian-skia + NativeBackend +
#   widget_host) compiles for iOS / Android cargo check, leaving
#   only the host-specific (Metal / Vulkan / event) integration to
#   Step 1f via the existing `EaglProvider` / `AndroidEglProvider`
#   plugin point.
#
# Invariant 3 (§11.1, §1.2): wasm32 builds of `op-host-web`
#   must NOT pull `jian-host-desktop` or `jian-skia` (skia-safe build.rs
#   fails on wasm32; Jian-core is wasm32-clean per P0.5 and is the only
#   Jian crate allowed in the bundle).
#
# Invariant 4 (§1.2): `op-host-web` must NOT depend on
#   `jian-host-desktop` at all — even as a non-default optional dep.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — all invariants pass.
#   1+ — one or more invariants fail; the failing crate names are
#         echoed before the script exits.
#
# Dependencies: `cargo`, `jq` (for cargo metadata JSON parsing).

# ── Invariant 2: mobile targets don't pull desktop-only backends. ────
# `cargo tree` honours `--target` cfg-gates so only the deps that
# actually compile under the mobile target are listed. `jian-skia` IS
# allowed on mobile (2026-05-10 user directive — widget render stack
# extends to iOS / Android); we still forbid `jian-host-desktop`
# because it pulls winit / glutin / desktop GLContextProvider impls
# that have no mobile equivalent. QuickJS is also forbidden: its
# rquickjs-sys package has no generated bindings for these targets and
# script generation is only used by the desktop `gl-host` Preview path.
