# tools/check-wasm-bundle.sh — Step 1b §6 + §7.1 local bundle gate.
#
# What this script enforces (matches the CanvasKit production bundle gate
# and the env.* import count guard):
#   1. Required local tools are available: cargo, wasm-bindgen, wasm-opt,
#      node, python3, and gzip. CanvasKit needs no EMSDK / skia-safe / libc shim.
#   2. cargo build → wasm-bindgen → wasm-opt -Oz pipeline produces the
#      served crates/op-host-web/pkg/op_host_web_bg.wasm. `wasm-opt` is invoked
#      with the core WebAssembly features emitted by current rustc.
#   3. Post-bindgen bundle has 0 env.* imports
#      (i.e. all imports come from `./op_host_web_bg.js`,
#      the wasm-bindgen JS shim). Any env.* import = LinkError at
#      load time → regression → fail.
#   4. Post wasm-opt -Oz gzip size ≤ STEP1B_SHELL_WASM_GZIP_LIMIT_BYTES
#      (default 6 291 456 bytes = 6 MiB for the full CanvasKit app logic).
#
# This script is the local counterpart to
# `.github/workflows/wasm-bundle-build.yml`; keep the two recipes aligned.
#
# Exit semantics:
#   0   all four checks PASS.
#   1   any check FAILED — message names which one.
#   2   prerequisite missing (cargo / wasm-bindgen / wasm-opt / node / python3 / gzip).

# The wasm feature flags rustc emits for wasm32-unknown-unknown that wasm-opt

# on their spelling: newer binaryen (dev machines, v117+) split bulk-memory into
# `bulk-memory` (memory.init/data.drop) + `bulk-memory-opt` (memory.copy/fill),
# while older binaryen (e.g. Ubuntu's apt `binaryen`) predates the split and its
# single `--enable-bulk-memory` already covers memory.copy/fill. Passing an
# unknown flag hard-fails wasm-opt ("Unknown option"), so we filter the list
# down to only the flags the installed wasm-opt actually advertises in --help.

# Ceiling for the CanvasKit production bundle's gzipped wasm. It is far above
# the retired skia raster path's 1 MiB (spec §6) because this bundle carries the
# FULL app logic absorbed from the skia path (codegen AI pipeline, Figma parser,
# AI/live-sync, collaboration) plus the remaining embedded product assets —
# scene-template .op documents, the iconify core catalog, and the AI skill
# corpus.
#
# Re-baselined from 8 MiB to 6 MiB once the ~2.4 MiB of preview JPEGs moved out
# of the binary and behind the runtime `/pkg/assets/` fetch (step 4 above;
# `op_editor_core::web_assets`). The bundle measures ~5.35 MiB today, so the
# ceiling is still a runaway-regression tripwire rather than a budget — but a
# tripwire 3 MiB above the real number catches nothing, which is why it moves
# down with the bundle. TODO(perf): the template documents and icon catalog can
# follow the previews out; code-splitting the codegen + Figma paths is the
# larger remaining win. Override via env.
